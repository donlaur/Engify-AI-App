      "content": "## Introduction: Beyond Basic Queries – LLMs as a Data Analysis Co-Pilot\n\nThe Python Pandas library is the cornerstone of modern data analysis, but its rich and sometimes complex API can present a steep learning curve. Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful co-pilots in this domain, capable of translating natural language requests into executable Pandas code.\n\n**The Challenge:** Unconstrained use of `eval()` on LLM-generated code opens the door to arbitrary code execution—a critical security vulnerability.\n\n## Foundational Prompting for Pandas\n\n### Providing DataFrame Context\n\nThe most fundamental step is to include the DataFrame's schema and sample data:\n- `df.head()` - Show column names and sample data\n- `df.info()` - Show data types and null counts\n\n### Using High-Level Abstractions\n\nFrameworks like LlamaIndex offer tools such as `PandasQueryEngine`, which automates:\n- Injecting DataFrame context into prompts\n- Executing generated code\n- Customizable prompt templates\n\n## Advanced Technique 1: Iterative Code Generation\n\nThe most robust method is a \"Generate, Test, Refine\" cycle:\n\n1. **Generate Code** - LLM produces initial code\n2. **Automated Validation** - Execute in sandboxed environment\n3. **Capture Errors** - Get stdout/stderr messages\n4. **Refine Prompt** - Append error to original prompt\n5. **Regenerate** - LLM corrects the code\n\n**Example Error Feedback:**\n```\nYour code failed with: ImportError: name 'np' is not defined.\nPlease correct the code.\n```\n\n## Advanced Technique 2: Structured and Safe Execution\n\n### Structured Output\n\nRequest JSON format for reliable parsing:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": \"Natural language explanation\",\n  \"imports\": [\"pandas\", \"numpy\"],\n  \"code_block\": \"df.groupby('category').mean()\"\n}\n```\n\n### Security: Sandboxing\n\n**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:** Never use `eval()` directly on LLM output!\n\n**Production Solutions:**\n- Docker-based environments (ds-pycontain)\n- Lightweight microVMs (Firecracker)\n- Containerization with resource limits\n\n## Applications\n\n### Data Transformation\n- Grouping and aggregation\n- DataFrame merging\n- Missing value handling\n- Result synthesis to Markdown reports\n\n### Data Visualization\n- Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly code generation\n- Detailed task descriptions\n- Style specifications (titles, labels, colors)\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always provide context** - Include df.head() and df.info()\n2. **Use iterative validation** - Allow self-correction\n3. **Prioritize security** - Sandbox all execution\n4. **Enforce structured outputs** - Use JSON for reliability\n5. **Test edge cases** - NULL values, empty DataFrames\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLLMs can dramatically accelerate data analysis workflows, but safety and reliability require:\n- Clear, comprehensive data context\n- Iterative generation and validation loops\n- Secure, isolated execution environments\n- Structured outputs for programmatic use"

      "content": "## Introduction: Beyond Code Generation – AI as a Visualization Strategist\n\nData visualization is the art of telling a story with data. LLMs can serve a dual role: strategic advisor for what to visualize, and code generator for how to create it.\n\n## Phase 1: Strategic Brainstorming with AI\n\n### Identifying Key Data Points\n\nPrompt the LLM to suggest critical metrics:\n```\nI have e-commerce sales data with order_date, customer_id, product_category, and revenue.\nWhat KPIs should a marketing manager see on a dashboard?\n```\n\n### Choosing the Right Visualization Type\n\nLLMs can recommend chart types based on analytical goals:\n- **Line graphs** - Trends over time\n- **Bar charts** - Categorical comparisons\n- **Scatter plots** - Correlations\n- **Heatmaps** - Distributions\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n```\nRecommend chart types to visualize:\n1. Monthly revenue trend over past year\n2. Revenue comparison across product categories\n```\n\n## Phase 2: Designing Dashboards\n\n### Audience-Specific Layouts\n\n**Executive Dashboard:**\n- High-level KPIs\n- Trend lines\n- Minimal detail\n\n**Operational Dashboard:**\n- Granular metrics\n- Team performance stats\n- Drill-down capabilities\n\n### Optimizing for Clarity\n\nPrompt for design best practices:\n```\nProvide guidelines to optimize dashboard clarity:\n- Layout recommendations\n- White space usage\n- Consistent labeling\n- Color schemes that highlight important info\n```\n\n### Incorporating Interactivity\n\nSuggest interactive features:\n- Date range filters\n- Regional filters\n- Drill-down capabilities\n- Hover tooltips\n\n## Phase 3: Generating Visualization Code\n\n### Structured Prompt Template\n\n```\n**Role:** You are a data visualization expert proficient in Python's Seaborn library.\n\n**Data Context:** \nYou will plot a pandas DataFrame named df.\nHere is df.head():\n[PASTE SAMPLE DATA]\n\n**Plot Description (The 'What'):**\nCreate a bar chart displaying average 'revenue' for each 'product_category'.\n\n**Plot Style (The 'How'):**\n- Title: 'Average Revenue by Product Category'\n- Y-axis label: 'Average Revenue ($)'\n- Professional color palette\n- Clean white background\n\n**Output Format:**\nProvide only the complete, executable Python code.\n```\n\n## Modern Tools\n\nAI-powered platforms streamlining the workflow:\n- **Julius.ai** - Natural language to visualization\n- **ThoughtSpot** - Interactive data exploration\n- Built-in prompt engineering\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Be specific** - Detailed chart descriptions\n2. **Provide data samples** - Show actual data structure\n3. **Specify styling** - Colors, labels, titles\n4. **Request exact format** - Code only, no explanations\n5. **Test with real data** - Verify accuracy\n\n## Conclusion: Human-AI Partnership\n\nThe three-phase process:\n1. **Strategize** - What story to tell\n2. **Design** - How to tell it\n3. **Generate** - Create the code\n\nHuman expertise remains essential for:\n- Defining analytical goals\n- Curating design\n- Interpreting results\n- Ensuring accuracy"

Fallback and Escalation Logic\n\n**Triggers for Human Handoff:**\n- Explicit user request\n- Detected frustration (sentiment analysis)\n- Repeated bot failures\n- Complex edge cases\n\n## Design Pattern 1: Retrieval vs. Generative\n\n**Retrieval-Based:**\n- Selects from predefined responses\n- Consistent and safe\n- Limited flexibility\n\n**Generative:**\n- Creates original responses\n- Flexible and creative\n- Risk of incorrect content\n\n**RAG (Hybrid):**\n- Best of both worlds\n- Factual safety + natural language\n\n## Design Pattern 2: Conversation Flows\n\n**Design Process:**\n1. Define chatbot's goal\n2. Map conversation paths visually\n3. Build branching logic\n4. Plan fallbacks\n5. Define exit points\n\n**Tools:**\n- Miro\n- Whimsical\n- Flowchart software\n\n## Design Pattern 3: Agentic Architecture\n\nLLM as reasoning engine that:\n- Decides on action sequences\n- Calls external tools\n- Performs multi-step workflows\n\n**Example Tools:**\n- Flight search API\n- Hotel availability checker\n- Booking system\n\n**Frameworks:**\n- LangChain\n- Semantic Kernel\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Modular design** - Separate components\n2. **RAG for grounding** - Factual accuracy\n3. **Multi-layered memory** - Context management\n4. **Clear escalation paths** - Graceful failure\n5. **Tool-using agents** - Complex workflows\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA production chatbot is a system, not just an LLM:\n- Orchestration for routing\n- RAG for accuracy\n- Memory for context\n- Fallbacks for reliability\n- Tools for complex tasks"
