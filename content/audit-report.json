This would help engineers make informed decisions about their documentation needs.\n\n5. **Add Diagrams and Visuals:** Encourage the inclusion of sample diagrams or visuals that illustrate the proposed solution section. This would aid in understanding complex designs and improve the document's clarity.\n\n**Missing Elements for More Value:**\n\n- **Examples of Completed Design Docs:** Real-world examples would help engineers visualize the end product and understand the level of detail required.\n- **Feedback and Iteration Process:** Guidance on how to iterate on the design document based on stakeholder feedback would be valuable.\n- **Integration with Other Documentation:** Suggestions on how to link the design doc with other project documentation (e.g., PRDs, RFCs) to create a cohesive documentation strategy.\n\nOverall, the prompt is well-structured and relevant to engineers, but it could be enhanced with additional examples, use cases, and best practices to maximize its effectiveness and applicability in real-world engineering scenarios.",
        "pattern_specific_reviewer_template": "**Score: 7/10**\n\n**Pattern Implementation:**\nThe prompt correctly implements the Template Pattern by providing a structured format for creating a Technical Design Document. It outlines specific sections and provides placeholders for necessary information, which aligns with the goals of using a template.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- The template structure is clear and easy to parse.\n- Placeholder text is provided, guiding the user on what information to include.\n- The prompt specifies required fields, such as the problem statement, goals, and proposed solution.\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n- The template is somewhat rigid, lacking flexibility for unique project requirements or additional sections that may be necessary.\n- Some sections, like diagrams, are mentioned but not detailed enough in terms of what specific content or format is expected.\n\n**Pattern Effectiveness:**\nThe Template Pattern is an appropriate choice for this use case, as it ensures consistency and completeness in technical design documentation. However, the pattern could be enhanced by allowing more customization options.\n\n**Pattern Optimization:**\n- Provide examples or sample content for each section to guide users better.\n- Include optional fields or sections that users can choose to fill out if relevant to their specific project.\n- Expand on the diagrams section by specifying what types of diagrams are expected and providing examples.\n\n**Missing Elements:**\n- Examples or case studies illustrating how the template has been used effectively in real-world scenarios.\n- Guidance on how to approach each section, possibly incorporating best practices or common pitfalls to avoid.\n- A section for \"Risks and Mitigations\" to address potential challenges and how they might be managed.\n\n**Pattern Combination:**\n- Consider combining with a \"Chain-of-Thought\" pattern more explicitly by providing prompts or questions that guide the user through the reasoning process for each section.\n- Integrate a \"Checklist Pattern\" to ensure all critical elements are covered before finalizing the document.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Enhance flexibility by allowing for additional or customized sections.\n- Provide more detailed guidance and examples for complex sections like diagrams.\n- Consider user feedback to iteratively improve the template's usability and relevance to various projects.",

What is the current status of the doc...\n\nEVALUATION:\nI'll evaluate the Technical Design Document Generator prompt based on its actual execution.\n\n🔍 Prompt Execution Test Results:\n\n### Output Analysis:\nThe prompt generated a template for a technical design document, but did not fully complete a specific design document. Instead, it provided a structured outline with clarifying questions, which is partially useful but not a complete execution.\n\n### Detailed Evaluation:\n\n1. Output Quality Scores:\n- Output Quality: 5/10 \n  - Provides a good template structure\n  - Lacks actual content generation\n  - Requires significant user input\n\n- Relevance: 6/10\n  - Matches the general intent of creating a design doc\n  - Needs more specific guidance for completion\n\n- Completeness: 4/10\n  - Template is incomplete\n  - Stops midway through sections\n  - Requires manual filling of details\n\n- Usability: 5/10\n  - Provides a starting framework\n  - Needs substantial manual work to be actionable\n\n- Reliability: 6/10\n  - Consistent template structure\n  - Inconsistent in fully generating content\n\n### 🚨 Key Issues Discovered:\n1. Prompt does not auto-generate a complete design document\n2. Requires extensive manual input\n3. Stops generating midway through sections\n4. More of a template generator than a full document creator\n\n### 🛠 Improvement Recommendations:\n1. Add more specific context-driven content generation\n2. Implement logic to auto-fill sections based on initial input\n3. Create a more robust content generation mechanism\n4. Add examples or sample content to demonstrate full document generation\n5. Include more detailed prompting for each section\n\n### Overall Quality Assessment: 5/10\nThe prompt shows promise but fails to fully automate design document creation. It's more of a structured guide than a true generative tool.\n\n### Suggested Prompt Enhancement:\n```\nWhen generating a Technical Design Document, ALWAYS:\n1. Ask for specific context about the feature/system\n2. Generate complete, detailed sections using that context\n3. Provide concrete examples and rationales\n4. Include potential implementation approaches\n5. Simulate a real, comprehensive design document\n```\n\nRecommendation: Revise the prompt to be more prescriptive and context-aware, focusing on generating substantive content rather than just a template.\n\nWould you like me to demonstrate a more effective approach to generating a technical design document?",

        "roles_use_cases_reviewer": "**Score: 6/10**\n\n### Issues and Recommendations:\n\n1. **Role Assignment:**\n   - **Issue:** The prompt assigns roles to Product Managers (PMs) and UX Designers but does not explicitly mention Engineers, who are also key stakeholders in the creation and use of functional specifications.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Engineers need to understand the functional specs to build the product effectively. Their involvement ensures that the specifications are technically feasible and comprehensive.\n   - **Recommendation:** Include Engineers in the role assignment.\n   - **Example:** \"Act as a Product Manager, UX Designer, and Engineer. Guide me through creating a Functional Specification...\"\n\n2. **Use Cases:**\n   - **Issue:** The prompt lacks specific use cases demonstrating how different roles can utilize the functional spec generator.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Use cases help users understand how the tool can be applied in real-world scenarios, enhancing its utility and relevance.\n   - **Recommendation:** Add use cases for PMs, Designers, and Engineers.\n   - **Example Use Case for PMs:** \"Use Case: 'Defining Product Requirements - Use this prompt to outline clear and comprehensive product requirements when starting a new project.'\"\n   - **Example Use Case for Designers:** \"Use Case: 'Designing User Interfaces - Use this prompt to ensure UI/UX specifications align with user stories and product requirements.'\"\n   - **Example Use Case for Engineers:** \"Use Case: 'Building Features - Use this prompt to understand the user-facing functionality and acceptance criteria when implementing new features.'\"\n\n3. **Comprehensiveness:**\n   - **Issue:** The prompt does not cover different scenarios or phases of product development where a functional spec might be used.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Different phases of product development require different focuses in a functional spec, such as initial ideation versus final approval.\n   - **Recommendation:** Include scenarios such as initial drafting, review, and final approval.\n   - **Example:** \"Scenario: 'Review Phase - Use this prompt to refine and validate functional specifications during the review phase with stakeholders.'\"\n\n4. **Alignment:**\n   - **Issue:** The roles mentioned do not fully align with the content, as Engineers are not included, yet they are critical users of functional specs.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Misalignment can lead to confusion about who should use the tool and how it fits into their workflow.\n   - **Recommendation:** Ensure all relevant roles are included and aligned with the content.\n   - **Example:** \"Include Engineers in the role assignment and ensure their needs are addressed in the content.\"\n\n5. **Value:**\n   - **Issue:** The value of the functional spec generator is not clearly demonstrated through examples or case studies.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Users need to see the tangible benefits and applications of the tool to appreciate its value.\n   - **Recommendation:** Provide examples or case studies that illustrate successful use of the functional spec generator.\n   - **Example:** \"Case Study: 'How [Company] Improved Product Development Efficiency by 30% Using the Functional Spec Generator.'\"\n\nBy addressing these issues, the prompt can become more comprehensive, relevant, and valuable to its intended users.",
