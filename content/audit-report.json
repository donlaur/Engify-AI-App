It outlines a clear process with defined sections and placeholders for input, which is a key aspect of the Template Pattern.\n\n**Best Practices**: The prompt follows several best practices for the Template Pattern:\n- It provides a clear template structure with sections like \"Research Data,\" \"Synthesis Process,\" and \"Recommendations.\"\n- It includes placeholder text and examples, such as \"[Interviews, surveys, usability tests, analytics]\" and \"[Number and type].\"\n- It specifies a step-by-step process for synthesizing data, which helps ensure consistency and thoroughness.\n\n**Common Mistakes**:\n- The template could be considered somewhat rigid, as it may not allow for flexibility in cases where the research data or synthesis process deviates from the outlined structure.\n- Some placeholder text could be clearer, particularly in sections like \"Design Implications\" and \"Recommendations,\" where more guidance on expected input could be helpful.\n\n**Pattern Effectiveness**: The Template Pattern is a suitable choice for the use case, as it provides a consistent and structured approach to synthesizing user research data. This helps ensure that insights are extracted methodically and communicated effectively.\n\n**Pattern Optimization**:\n- Introduce optional fields or sections to allow for more flexibility in the synthesis process.\n- Provide more detailed examples or guidance within each section to help users understand the type of input expected.\n\n**Missing Elements**:\n- The prompt could benefit from examples or case studies to illustrate how the template can be applied in real-world scenarios.\n- It lacks a clear distinction between required and optional fields, which could help users prioritize their input.\n\n**Pattern Combination**: Combining this Template Pattern with an Example Pattern could enhance understanding by providing concrete examples of completed templates. This would help users see how the template can be applied in practice and what a successful output looks like.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n1. Add optional fields or sections to increase flexibility and accommodate different research scenarios.\n2. Include examples or case studies to provide context and illustrate the template's application.\n3. Clarify placeholder text and provide more guidance on expected input, particularly in sections like \"Design Implications\" and \"Recommendations.\"\n4.

While it addresses a common issue (poorly created personas), it doesn't provide contextual examples or case studies that designers might encounter in their projects.\n\n3. **Terminology:** The language and terminology used are appropriate for designers, focusing on key aspects of personas such as goals, motivations, behaviors, and pain points.\n\n4. **Practicality:** The prompt is practical in addressing a real problem (the creation of ineffective personas), but it could benefit from more detailed guidance on how to implement the solution pattern effectively.\n\n5. **Accessibility:** The prompt is accessible and understandable for designers, but it could be enhanced with more structured guidance and examples to ensure clarity.\n\n6. **Value:** The prompt provides value by emphasizing the importance of focusing on goals and motivations rather than demographics, but it lacks depth in terms of actionable steps and examples.\n\n**Recommendations for Improving Relevance to Designers:**\n\n1. **Include Use Cases:** Provide specific use cases or scenarios where designers might need to create detailed personas. This could include different types of projects or industries.\n\n2. **Add Examples:** Include examples of well-crafted personas and poorly crafted ones to illustrate the difference and provide a clearer understanding.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Offer more detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to gather and synthesize research data into effective personas.\n\n4. **Best Practices:** Incorporate best practices for persona creation, such as involving stakeholders in the process or using data-driven insights.\n\n5. **Case Studies:** If possible, include case studies that demonstrate the impact of well-crafted personas on a project’s success.\n\n**Missing Elements:**\n\n1. **Research Methods:** Suggestions on research methods to gather the necessary data for creating personas would be beneficial.\n\n2. **Collaboration Tips:** Guidance on how to collaborate with other team members or stakeholders when creating personas could enhance the prompt.\n\n3. **Tools and Resources:** Recommendations for tools or resources that can assist in the persona creation process would add value.\n\n4. **Measurement of Impact:** Suggestions on how to measure the effectiveness of personas in improving user experience and design decisions.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and missing elements, the prompt could be more valuable and practical for designers, providing them with a comprehensive guide to creating effective user personas.",
        "prompt_execution_test": "EXECUTION RESULT:\n## Step-by-Step Guidance for Creating Detailed and Representative User Personas\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem Context\n- **Identify the Core Issue**: Many personas are created with an overemphasis on demographic data, such as age, gender, or income, which may not directly influence user behavior or needs.\n- **Focus on User Needs**: The goal is to develop personas that provide insights into users' goals, motivations, behaviors, and pain points, which are more critical for designing user-centered products.\n\n### Step 2: Gather and Analyze Research Data\n- **Conduct User Research**: Employ methods such as interviews, surveys, and observations to gather qualitative and quantitative data about your users.\n- **Identify Themes**: Analyze the data to identify common themes related to user goals...\n\nEVALUATION:\nI'll evaluate the prompt execution test result based on the specified criteria:\n\n## Prompt Execution Test Analysis\n\n### Actual Output Assessment\n\n**Output Breakdown:**\n- The response provides a structured approach to creating user personas\n- Includes step-by-step guidance\n- Focuses on research-driven persona development\n- Highlights the importance of moving beyond demographic data\n\n### Evaluation Criteria Scoring:\n\n1. **Output Quality**: 7/10\n   - Provides solid conceptual guidance\n   - Structured and clear approach\n   - Lacks specific persona template or example\n\n2. **Relevance**: 8/10\n   - Directly addresses the core problem of poor persona creation\n   - Emphasizes critical aspects of persona development\n   - Aligns well with the original prompt intent\n\n3. **Completeness**: 6/10\n   - Offers good process guidance\n   - Incomplete - cuts off mid-explanation\n   - Missing concrete implementation details\n\n4. **Usability**: 6/10\n   - Provides conceptual framework\n   - Needs more practical implementation guidance\n   - Lacks a ready-to-use persona template\n\n5. **Reliability**: 7/10\n   - Consistent approach to persona development\n   - Solid methodology\n   - Would likely produce similar results across different contexts\n\n### Overall Quality Assessment: 7/10\n\n### Issues Identified:\n1. Incomplete output (text appears to be truncated)\n2. Lacks a specific persona template\n3. No concrete examples provided\n4. Theoretical approach without practical implementation details\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\n1. Complete the full explanation without truncation\n2. Include a specific persona template with fillable sections\n3. Provide a concrete example of a fully developed persona\n4. Add more specific guidance on research methods\n5. Include techniques for validating and refining personas\n\n### Execution Test Conclusion:\nThe prompt shows promise in addressing the core challenge of persona creation, but requires refinement to be truly actionable. The output provides valuable conceptual guidance but falls short of delivering a complete, immediately usable solution.\n\nSuggested Prompt Modification:\n```\nAct as a Product Designer specializing in user research. Create a comprehensive user persona template that:\n1. Provides a detailed, research-backed persona framework\n2. Includes specific sections for goals, motivations, behaviors, and pain points\n3. Offers a concrete example persona for reference\n4. Includes validation and refinement techniques\n5.
