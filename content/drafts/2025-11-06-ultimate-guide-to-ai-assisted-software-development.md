## Implementation: Practical, Copy-Paste-able

Here’s a simple example of how AI can assist in code refactoring using GitHub Copilot:

```python
# Original code
def calculate_total(price, tax):
    total = price + (price * tax)
    return total

# Refactored code with AI assistance
def calculate_total(price, tax):
    return price * (1 + tax)
```

In this example, GitHub Copilot suggests a cleaner and more efficient way to calculate the total price by simplifying the arithmetic operation. Such small improvements can accumulate, leading to significant productivity gains over time.
