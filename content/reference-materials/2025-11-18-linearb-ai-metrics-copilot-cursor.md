# Measuring the Impact of Copilot and Cursor on Engineering Productivity

**Source:** LinearB Marketing Email
**Received:** November 18, 2025
**Category:** AI Productivity & Metrics

## The Challenge

If your engineering team is leveraging AI tools to boost developer productivity, how do you know if it's making your developers' jobs better and not worse?

## The Solution: Unified Metrics Dashboard

Finding answers may require juggling multiple dashboards. With LinearB, bring engineering metrics together in one place to quickly understand trends across teams and tools at a glance.

## GitHub Copilot & Cursor Integration

If you're using GitHub Copilot or Cursor, you can now integrate with out-of-the-box metrics dashboards to view:

### Core Adoption Metrics
- **Adoption rate across your organization**
  - Track how many developers are using AI tools
  - Measure organizational penetration
  - Identify adoption barriers

- **Daily active and engaged users**
  - Monitor consistent usage patterns
  - Track engagement levels over time
  - Identify power users vs. occasional users

### AI Code Generation Metrics
- **Code suggestions generated by AI**
  - Volume of AI-generated suggestions
  - Trends over time
  - Per-developer breakdowns

- **Acceptance of AI-generated code**
  - What percentage of suggestions are accepted?
  - Quality signals from acceptance rates
  - Developer trust in AI suggestions

### SDLC Impact Correlation

You can also correlate AI adoption and its impact across your SDLC, benchmarking metrics such as:

1. **Cycle time**
   - Time from commit to production
   - Impact of AI on development velocity
   - Before/after AI adoption comparisons

2. **PR size**
   - Average pull request size
   - Code quality implications
   - Review efficiency metrics

3. **Refactor rates**
   - Frequency of code refactoring
   - Technical debt management
   - Code quality trends

4. **And others**
   - Additional SDLC metrics
   - Custom benchmarking
   - Team-specific KPIs

## Why This Matters for Engineering Leaders

### Key Questions Answered:
1. **Is AI helping or hurting?**
   - Objective data on productivity impact
   - Identify where AI adds value
   - Spot areas where AI may slow teams down

2. **Who's benefiting most?**
   - Identify power users and best practices
   - Understand adoption patterns
   - Share successful workflows across teams

3. **What's the ROI?**
   - Measure time savings
   - Calculate cost/benefit
   - Justify AI tool investments

4. **Where should we improve?**
   - Find gaps in adoption
   - Identify training opportunities
   - Optimize tool configuration
