# You already have access to OpenSearch - start using it today

**Source:** DigitalOcean Marketing Email
**Received:** November 18, 2025
**Category:** Infrastructure & Observability

## Executive Summary

OpenSearch is already powering your Gradient AI knowledge bases behind the scenes. Since you already have access to it, you can use it for your application logs, metrics, and observability needs too.

## Pricing Structure

- **Single-node clusters**: Start at **$19/month**
- **Configuration**: 2 GiB RAM and 40 GiB storage
- **Additional storage**: **$0.21 per GiB per month**
- **Storage increments**: 10 GB at a time

## Market Opportunity

### The log management market is booming for good reason

The demand for global log management market is projected to reach **$10.08 billion in 2034** from **$3.27 billion in 2024**, representing a compound annual growth rate of **11.92%**.

This growth is driven by:
- Expanding complexity of IT environments
- Increasing security threats
- Stringent compliance requirements that organizations face today

Teams processing thousands of operations per second like yours are turning to centralized log management to maintain visibility into their systems. When issues arise, they can search millions of log entries in seconds to find the root cause.

## What OpenSearch adds to your platform

### Centralized log management
Forward logs from Droplets, Managed Databases, App Platform, and Kubernetes to a single searchable location. No more scattered logs across multiple systems or SSH sessions to check what's happening on individual servers. Everything flows into one place where you can search, filter, and analyze it.

### Real-time search and analytics
Query logs instantly, identify patterns, and troubleshoot issues faster. OpenSearch can handle millions of log entries with sub-second response times. Use its powerful query language to drill down into exactly what you need, whether that's error messages from a specific time window or performance metrics across your entire infrastructure.

### Enhanced AI observability
Monitor your AI agents, track model performance, and analyze API usage patterns. Get deeper insights into how your Gradient AI applications are performing. See which knowledge base queries are most common, identify slow agent responses, and understand user interaction patterns.

### Customizable dashboards and visualizations
The OpenSearch Dashboard gives you a powerful interface for exploring your data. Build custom dashboards to monitor the metrics that matter most to your business. Set up alerts to notify you when things go wrong, track trends over time, and share insights with your team.

## Simple setup, powerful results

Since OpenSearch is already part of your Gradient AI infrastructure, activation is straightforward. You can have your first logs flowing in about 5 minutes.

The same OpenSearch technology that indexes your knowledge base documents can index your application logs, error traces, performance metrics, and any other data you need to search and analyze. You're already familiar with how it works—now you can apply that power to your operational data.

## Getting Started Guide

### 1. Create an OpenSearch cluster
Head to your DigitalOcean control panel and create a new OpenSearch cluster. Select your preferred data center region—we recommend choosing the same region as your Gradient AI resources to minimize latency.

Choose your cluster configuration based on your expected log volume:
- **Single-node clusters**: Start at $19/month (good for development or low-traffic applications)
- **3-node clusters**: Recommended for production workloads for high availability

### 2. Forward logs from your applications
Use our built-in integrations to start forwarding logs. If you're using Managed Databases, you can enable log forwarding with just a few clicks in the control panel. For Droplets and App Platform, we provide straightforward configuration guides.

You can forward logs from multiple sources to the same OpenSearch cluster, making it easy to correlate events across your infrastructure. See an error in your application logs and want to check if there was a database slowdown at the same time? It's all in one place.

### 3. Access the OpenSearch Dashboard
Once logs start flowing in, access the OpenSearch Dashboard through your DigitalOcean control panel. Run your first queries to explore your data, set up index patterns to organize your logs, and create visualizations to monitor key metrics.

#### Dashboard Features:
- Full-text search across all your logs
- Time-based filtering and analysis
- Aggregations to summarize your data
- Custom dashboards for different teams or use cases

## Predictable pricing you can trust

OpenSearch clusters start at $19/month for single-node deployments with 2 GiB RAM and 40 GiB storage with additional storage available in 10 GB increments at $0.21 per GiB per month.

Since you're using Gradient AI, you're already familiar with how OpenSearch stores and indexes data—this just extends that capability to your operational logs. There are no surprise charges, no per-query fees, and no data egress costs between your DigitalOcean resources.
