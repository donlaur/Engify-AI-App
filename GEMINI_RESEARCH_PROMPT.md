# Gemini Deep Research: Prompt Engineering Patterns for Engify.ai

## Project Overview

**Engify.ai** is an AI adoption education platform designed to help engineering teams, product managers, and developers transition from AI fear to AI fluency through curated prompt engineering best practices.

### Core Mission
Transform how engineers and product teams use AI by teaching them professional prompt engineering patterns, not just giving them prompts to copy.

## What We're Building

### Platform Features

**1. Curated Prompt Library (100+ Templates)**
- Role-specific prompts for engineers, product managers, designers
- Each prompt uses proven patterns (Persona, CoT, Template, etc.)
- Categorized by use case: code review, architecture, debugging, feature specs
- Every prompt is tested with real AI APIs and graded (A-F)

**2. Interactive Workbench**
- Test prompts with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Real-time execution with company API keys (rate-limited for security)
- See token usage, cost, and latency
- Compare responses across providers

**3. Prompt Pattern Education**
- Learn different prompt engineering patterns
- Understand when to use each pattern
- Token efficiency optimization
- Best practices from leading AI companies

**4. Quality Assurance System**
- Automated testing of every prompt template
- Grading system (0-100 score, A-F grade)
- Criteria: length, content accuracy, format, tone, token efficiency
- Human review option for quality control

**5. Usage Tracking & Security**
- Rate limiting per user (prevent abuse of company keys)
- Track tokens, cost, requests per user
- Detect prompt injection attempts
- Block malicious patterns (jailbreaks, system manipulation)

## Additional Context

**Why This Matters**:
- Most developers copy-paste prompts without understanding patterns
- Generic prompts waste tokens and produce poor results
- No standardized education for engineering/product prompt engineering
- Companies need their teams to use AI effectively and safely

**Our Differentiation**:
- Focus on engineering and product use cases (not general AI chat)
- Teach patterns, not just provide prompts
- Test and grade every prompt template
- Token efficiency optimization
- Security-first approach (rate limiting, injection detection)

**Platform Constraints**:
- Must work with company API keys (not user's keys initially)
- Need to minimize token costs (rate limiting required)
- Mobile-first design (prompts must work on small screens)
- Local development first (AWS deployment later)
