# FORCE VERCEL REBUILD

This file exists to force Vercel to rebuild.

Timestamp: Sun Nov 2 2025 16:51 PM

Issue: ArticleContent.tsx simplified to server component but Vercel keeps serving old client component build with React error #130.

Latest commit: Fixed in 05bafa5, but Vercel deployments not picking it up.

This file will trigger a rebuild.
