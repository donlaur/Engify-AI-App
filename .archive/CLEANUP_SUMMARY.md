# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive cleanup and reorganization to transform the repository into an enterprise-grade, professional codebase suitable for public viewing and portfolio presentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Organization

**Moved to `.archive/development-notes/`:**

- `200_COMMIT_SPRINT.md`
- `CURRENT_PLAN.md`
- `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md`
- `HOUR_2_AI_INTEGRATION.md`
- `MAKE_REPO_PUBLIC.md`
- `MISSING_FEATURES.md`
- `NEXT_STEPS.md`
- `TONIGHT_PLAN.md`
- `TEST_RESULTS.md`

**Moved to `.archive/research/`:**

- `GEMINI_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md`
- `GEMINI_RESEARCH_COMPLETE.md`
- `PROMPT_LIBRARY_ANALYSIS.md`

**Moved to `docs/deployment/`:**

- `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `VERCEL_DEPLOY.md`
- `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md`

**Moved to `docs/`:**

- `SETUP.md`
- `SETUP_AUTH.md`

### 2. New Professional Documentation

**Created:**

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines and code standards
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and design patterns
- `RELEASE_NOTES_500.md` - Milestone documentation

**Kept in Root (Public-Facing):**

- `README.md` - Main project overview
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `RELEASE_NOTES_500.md` - Version history

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

**Eliminated Hardcoded Values:**

- Replaced all hardcoded "67" with `siteStats.totalPrompts`
- Updated `/app/pricing/page.tsx`
- Updated `/app/about/page.tsx`
- Updated `/app/patterns/page.tsx`
- Updated `/components/chat/ChatWidget.tsx`

**Single Source of Truth:**

- All statistics now come from `/lib/site-stats.ts`
- Prompt counts dynamically calculated from `/data/playbooks.ts`
- No duplicate data across codebase

### 4. README Improvements

**Changed:**

- Removed "498 commits in one day" → "Enterprise-grade prompt engineering platform"
- Updated status line to focus on features, not commit count
- Updated prompt count from "66+" to "100+"
- More professional, less "built in public" language
