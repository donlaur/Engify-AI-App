# Test Reports Directory

This directory stores batch test results from the prompt testing framework.

## Usage

### Run Tests
```bash
# Test first batch (prompts 1-10) with both providers
pnpm test:prompts

# Test specific batch
pnpm test:prompts --batch=2

# Test with specific provider
pnpm test:prompts --provider=openai
pnpm test:prompts --provider=gemini
```

### Analyze Results
```bash
pnpm analyze:tests
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **API Credits**: These tests use real API calls and consume credits. Run manually only!

⚠️ **Rate Limits**: Tests include 2-second delays between requests to respect rate limits.

⚠️ **Batch Size**: Default is 10 prompts per batch. Adjust in `scripts/test-prompts-batch.ts` if needed.

## Report Format

Each test generates a JSON report with:
- Success/failure rates
- Response times
- Quality metrics
- Error details
- Provider comparison

## Quality Metrics

- **hasStructure**: Response has headings or lists
- **hasExamples**: Response includes examples
- **isCoherent**: Response is well-formed and substantial
- **followsPattern**: Response follows expected pattern behavior
