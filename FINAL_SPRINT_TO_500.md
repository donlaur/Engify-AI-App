## 💼 Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about a project you're proud of"

**Answer**:
"I built Engify.ai, an AI engineering education platform, with 500 commits over [X weeks]. It includes:

- 107 learning resources covering LLMs, RAG, AI agents, and production AI
- 23 prompt engineering patterns with real-world examples
- Multi-provider AI integration (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq)
- Production-ready architecture with security documentation
- SOC 2 compliance roadmap

The platform is open source, built in public, and designed to help teams adopt AI effectively. I documented everything - from RAG implementation to security architecture - so it's not just code, it's a knowledge base.

The code is on GitHub, and I can walk you through the architecture, security decisions, and technical trade-offs."

### "Have you built RAG systems?"

**Answer**:
"Yes, I designed and documented a production RAG implementation for Engify.ai. It uses:

- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for embeddings
- In-memory vector store (scalable to Pinecone/Supabase)
- Cosine similarity search
- GPT-4 for generation
- <2 second latency
- $0.03 per query cost

I documented the full architecture, cost analysis, and implementation plan. The system indexes 500+ documents and provides context-aware answers with source citations. It's designed as a premium feature with a 98% profit margin."

### "How do you approach security?"

**Answer**:
"I conducted a comprehensive security architecture review covering SOC 2 and FedRAMP requirements. Key findings:

- Identified critical gaps (no auth, no audit logging)
- Documented remediation plan with timelines and costs
- Created RBAC system design
- Planned input validation strategy
- Estimated SOC 2 readiness at 6-9 months, $50K-100K

I understand defensive coding, OWASP Top 10, and compliance requirements. The review is documented and ready for implementation."
