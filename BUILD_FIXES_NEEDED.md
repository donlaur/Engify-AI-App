# Build Fixes Needed - CRITICAL

## Current Status: BUILD FAILING ‚ùå

**Last 20 pushes have broken Vercel builds**

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

### 1. RoleSelector Export Issue ‚úÖ FIXED

- **File**: `src/components/roles/RoleSelector.tsx`
- **Issue**: Had both default and named export
- **Fix**: Changed to named export only
- **Status**: FIXED in commit 468

### 2. Contact Page Prerender Error

- **File**: `src/app/contact/page.tsx`
- **Error**: "Element type is invalid"
- **Status**: INVESTIGATING

### 3. Other Prerender Errors

Pages failing to build:

- `/contact`
- `/about`
- `/kernel`
- `/mcp`
- `/learn`
- `/built-in-public`

---

## üîç Root Causes

### A. Missing Icon Exports

Many pages use `Icons.xyz` that don't exist in the icon library:

- `Icons.grid` ‚Üí doesn't exist
- `Icons.alert` ‚Üí doesn't exist
- `Icons.workflow` ‚Üí doesn't exist
- `Icons.layout` ‚Üí doesn't exist
- `Icons.twitter` ‚Üí doesn't exist
- `Icons.linkedin` ‚Üí doesn't exist
- `Icons.facebook` ‚Üí doesn't exist

**Solution**: Either add these icons or replace with existing ones

### B. Component Import Issues

Some components being imported don't have proper exports:

- RoleSelector (FIXED)
- Possibly others

### C. Type Errors (227 total)

- Playwright test files have type errors
- Service files have MongoDB type issues
- Component files have prop type issues

**Note**: Type errors don't break builds (types are skipped), but should be fixed

## üìã Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Build Errors (NOW)

1. ‚úÖ Fix RoleSelector export
2. ‚è≥ Identify all prerender errors
3. ‚è≥ Fix missing component imports
4. ‚è≥ Replace or add missing icons
5. ‚è≥ Test build passes

### Phase 2: Fix Type Errors (NEXT)

1. Fix Playwright test types
2. Fix MongoDB service types
3. Fix component prop types
4. Run `pnpm type-check` successfully

### Phase 3: Verify Deployment (FINAL)

1. Test build locally
2. Push to Vercel
3. Verify all pages load
4. Check for runtime errors

## üõë STOP ADDING FEATURES

**DO NOT**:

- Add new features
- Add new pages
- Add new components
- Make large changes

**DO**:

- Fix build errors
- Fix type errors
- Test thoroughly
- Document fixes

## üìä Build Error Log

### Latest Build Attempt:

```
Error occurred prerendering page "/contact"
[Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.]

Error occurred prerendering page "/about"
Error occurred prerender ing page "/kernel"
Error occurred prerendering page "/mcp"
Error occurred prerendering page "/learn"
Error occurred prerendering page "/built-in-public"
```

### Type Errors: 227

- 62 files affected
- Most are test files (can be ignored for now)
- Some are critical service files

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Build is fixed when:

1. ‚úÖ `pnpm build` completes successfully
2. ‚úÖ No prerender errors
3. ‚úÖ All pages generate static HTML
4. ‚úÖ Vercel deployment succeeds
5. ‚è≥ Type errors reduced to < 50

**Priority**: FIX BUILD FIRST, FEATURES LATER

**Current Commit**: 467/500
**Next Commit**: Build fixes only
