- [ ] Driver consults with Consulted roles
- [ ] Driver prepares recommendation document

**Phase 2: Review & Input (Recommenders)**
- [ ] Driver shares draft with Recommenders
- [ ] Recommenders provide feedback
- [ ] Driver incorporates feedback

**Phase 3: Approval (Approver)**
- [ ] Driver presents final recommendation to Approver
- [ ] Approver reviews and asks questions
- [ ] Approver makes decision

**Phase 4: Communication (Informed)**
- [ ] Decision communicated to Informed roles
- [ ] Rationale and next steps shared
- [ ] Questions answered

## Communication Plan

**To Recommenders:**
- "I'm driving this decision and would value your input. Can you review [document] by [date]?"

## RACI Best Practices

✅ **Only ONE Accountable per activity** - Multiple As = confusion
✅ **Multiple Responsible is OK** - Teams work together
✅ **Consulted early** - Don't consult at the last minute
✅ **Informed consistently** - Regular updates, not surprises
✅ **Document exceptions** - If someone is R and A, note why

## Common RACI Mistakes

❌ **Too many As** - "Who's really accountable?" becomes unclear
❌ **No A assigned** - Work falls through cracks
❌ **C treated as R** - Slows down work, creates bottlenecks
❌ **I not informed** - Creates confusion and resentment
❌ **Matrix too complex** - Hard to understand and maintain

## Responsibility Clarity Checklist

Before starting work:
- [ ] Everyone knows their R/A/C/I roles
- [ ] Accountable person identified for each activity
- [ ] Consulted roles know when they'll be asked
- [ ] Informed roles know how they'll receive updates
- [ ] Conflicts resolved (e.g., multiple As)

## Communication Plan

**To Responsible:**
- "You're responsible for [activity]. Here's what needs to be done: [details]"

**To Accountable:**
- "You're accountable for [activity]. [Person] is responsible. Check in [frequency]."

**To Consulted:**
- "We'll consult you on [aspect] before we proceed. Here's when: [timeline]"

    content: `You are an engineering manager using the Value vs. Effort matrix to prioritize initiatives. Generate a strategic prioritization matrix:

**Context:**
- Time Horizon: [Q1 / Q2 / H1 / Year]
- Team Capacity: [Available person-months]
- Strategic Goals: [Top 3-5 goals for this period]

**Generate a Value vs. Effort matrix:**

## Value vs. Effort Framework

**Value:** Business impact, user benefit, strategic importance (High/Medium/Low)
**Effort:** Person-months, complexity, risk (High/Medium/Low)

## The Four Quadrants

### 🎯 Quick Wins (High Value, Low Effort)
**Do First** - High ROI, builds momentum
- Ship these immediately
- Great for team morale
- Low risk, high reward

### 🚀 Big Bets (High Value, High Effort)
**Plan Carefully** - Major initiatives, significant impact
- Requires careful planning
- Allocate resources properly
- Break into phases
- Monitor closely

### ⏰ Fill-Ins (Low Value, Low Effort)
**Do When Free** - Nice to have, easy wins
- Good for downtime
- Don't block other work
- Low priority

### ❌ Time Sinks (Low Value, High Effort)
**Avoid** - Low ROI, waste of resources
- Don't do these
- Reconsider if value increases
- Or reduce effort significantly

## Initiative Matrix

**Time Period:** [Q1 2025]

| Initiative | Value | Effort | Quadrant | Priority | Owner | Timeline |
|------------|-------|--------|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| [Initiative 1] | High | Low | Quick Win | 1 | [Name] | [When] |
| [Initiative 2] | High | High | Big Bet | 2 | [Name] | [When] |
| [Initiative 3] | Low | Low | Fill-in | 5 | [Name] | [When] |
| [Initiative 4] | Low | High | Time Sink | Skip | - | - |

## Value Assessment Criteria

**High Value:**
- [ ] Aligns with strategic goals
- [ ] Significant user impact (>10K users)
- [ ] Revenue/cost impact
- [ ] Competitive advantage
- [ ] Reduces risk/tech debt
- [ ] Enables future work

**Medium Value:**
- [ ] Moderate user impact (1K-10K users)
- [ ] Incremental improvement
- [ ] Nice to have feature
- [ ] Quality of life improvement

**Low Value:**
- [ ] Minimal user impact (<1K users)
- [ ] Cosmetic changes
- [ ] "Would be nice"
- [ ] No clear business case

## Effort Assessment Criteria

**High Effort:**
- [ ] >3 person-months
- [ ] Complex architecture changes
- [ ] Multiple teams involved
- [ ] High technical risk
- [ ] Requires new skills/tools
- [ ] Dependencies on other work

**Medium Effort:**
- [ ] 1-3 person-months
- [ ] Moderate complexity
- [ ] Some technical risk
- [ ] Standard engineering work

**Low Effort:**
- [ ] <1 person-month
- [ ] Straightforward implementation
- [ ] Low technical risk
- [ ] Well-understood problem
- [ ] Can be done independently

## Prioritization Strategy

**Phase 1: Quick Wins (Weeks 1-4)**
- Ship 2-3 quick wins immediately
- Build momentum and credibility
- Show progress quickly

**Phase 2: Big Bets Planning (Weeks 1-2)**
- Break down big bets into phases
- Identify dependencies
- Allocate resources
- Start first phase

**Phase 3: Big Bets Execution (Weeks 3-12)**
- Execute big bets in phases
- Ship incrementally
- Monitor progress closely

**Phase 4: Fill-Ins (Throughout)**
- Do fill-ins during downtime
- Don't let them block quick wins or big bets
- Good for onboarding/learning

## Decision Framework

**For Each Initiative, Ask:**

1. **Value Questions:**
   - How many users benefit?
   - What's the business impact?
   - Does it align with goals?
   - What's the strategic importance?

2. **Effort Questions:**
   - How many person-months?
   - What's the complexity?
   - What are the risks?
   - What dependencies exist?

3. **Timing Questions:**
   - When is value highest?
   - When is effort lowest?
   - What's the opportunity cost?
   - Can we defer?

## Example Matrix Output

**Q1 2025 Roadmap**

**Quick Wins (Ship First):**
1. Add dark mode (High value, Low effort) - 2 weeks
