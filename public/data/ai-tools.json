Aider can modify existing files or create new ones based on conversational commands. Similar to Cline, Aider adheres to the BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model, requiring users to supply their own API keys for LLMs such as GPT-4. While Aider focuses on structured, Git-aware edits and command-line efficiency, it operates at a lower level of autonomy compared to Cline's browser interaction and MCP extensibility capabilities.","category":"Code Assistant","pricing":{"free":true,"paid":{"monthly":0,"tier":"Open Source"}},"features":["CLI-native terminal pair-programmer","Git-aware editing","Repository write access","Conversational code modification","BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model","Multi-file editing","Command-line efficiency"],"pros":["Lightweight CLI interface","Git-aware operations","Open-source and free","BYOK cost model","Fast terminal workflow"],"cons":["Limited to CLI interface","No browser interaction","No MCP extensibility","Lower autonomy than Cline","No visual debugging"],"tags":["autonomous-agent","cli","git-aware","byok","open-source","cline-alternative"],"icon":"terminal","websiteUrl":"https://aider.chat/","badges":["open-source","free","cli-tool"],"supportedModels":["GPT-4","Claude","Local models"],"agentCapabilities":["refactoring","file-creation","git-aware-editing"],"inspiredBy":"cline","cloneType":"alternative","marketplaceLinks":{"github":"https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider"},"slug":"aider","status":"active","createdAt":"2025-11-18T20:17:29.676Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-19T01:09:27.408Z","lastUpdated":"2025-11-19T01:09:27.408Z"},{"_id":"691cd45946c562e46f1beae7","id":"openhands","name":"OpenHands","tagline":"Full-capability autonomous software developer agent","description":"OpenHands is marketed as a \"full-capability software developer\" agent designed to perform a complete range of tasks, including modifying code, running commands, browsing the web, calling external APIs, and even sourcing code snippets from public repositories like StackOverflow.

This provides easier verification than full lists of model actions and tool calls.\n\nThe tool features deep browser integration via a Chrome extension (similar to Playwright MCP), allowing agents to directly test web applications they're building. Agents can learn from past work, retaining specific code snippets or steps required for certain tasks. Users can leave comments on specific Artifacts for agents to incorporate without interrupting their workflow.\n\nCurrently available in free public preview with generous rate limits for Gemini 3 Pro that refresh every five hours.
