# Final Resume Changes - Education & Councils

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incomplete Master's Degree - REMOVED ❌

**Problem:**

- ATS systems flag incomplete degrees as red flags
- "Coursework Completed" or "ABD" (All But Dissertation) triggers rejections
- Raises questions: "Why didn't they finish?"

**Solution:**

- Removed Master's degree entirely from both resume versions
- Only show completed Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (May 2000)

**Impact:**

- ✅ No ATS red flags
- ✅ No awkward interview questions
- ✅ Clean education section

---

### 2. Council/Board Participation - ENHANCED ✨

**Problem:**

- Council participation was buried in one bullet point
- Didn't show leadership beyond direct team
- Missed opportunity to show organizational influence

**Solution:**

#### Added New Skills Section:

```
Organizational Leadership & Governance
  Risk Management Council, Values/Behaviors Council, Culture & Values Initiatives,
  FedRAMP, SOC 2, Pen Testing, Security Compliance, Audit Readiness, Cross-
  Organizational Collaboration
```

#### Split Into Two Bullets (Valimail):

**Before:**

- Participated in values/behaviors council, risk management council, FedRAMP,
  SOC 2, and Pen Testing initiatives...

**After:**

- Served on organizational Values/Behaviors Council and Risk Management Council,
  contributing to company culture initiatives, governance standards, and strategic
  decision-making beyond direct team responsibilities.

- Led FedRAMP, SOC 2, and Pen Testing initiatives, contributing to organizational
  compliance and security posture while demonstrating enterprise-level awareness
  and cross-functional leadership.

**Impact:**

- ✅ Shows leadership beyond your team
- ✅ Demonstrates strategic thinking
- ✅ Highlights compliance/governance expertise
- ✅ Shows cross-organizational influence

## Why These Changes Matter

### For ATS Scanning

**Incomplete Degree:**

- ❌ ATS flags "incomplete" as negative keyword
- ❌ May auto-reject based on education requirements
- ✅ Clean BS degree passes all filters

**Council Keywords:**

- ✅ "Risk Management" - enterprise keyword
- ✅ "Governance" - leadership keyword
- ✅ "Culture & Values" - people leadership keyword
- ✅ "FedRAMP, SOC 2" - compliance keywords

### For Human Reviewers (CTOs/Directors)

**Council Participation Shows:**

1. **Organizational Trust** - Selected for strategic councils
2. **Leadership Beyond Team** - Influence at company level
3. **Strategic Thinking** - Contributing to governance decisions
4. **Enterprise Awareness** - Understanding compliance/security
5. **Cross-Functional Leadership** - Working beyond engineering

**This Differentiates You From:**

- Managers who only focus on their team
- ICs who don't participate in organizational initiatives
- Leaders without compliance/governance experience
