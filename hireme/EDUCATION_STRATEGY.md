# Education Strategy - Master's Coursework

## The Problem

**Incomplete degrees trigger ATS rejections:**

- Keywords like "incomplete," "ABD," "coursework completed" = red flags
- ATS systems may auto-reject
- Raises questions in interviews: "Why didn't you finish?"

## The Solution

**Mention it in Summary, not Education section:**

### ✅ GOOD (What We Did)

```
SUMMARY
Forward-thinking Engineering Manager with 20+ years building high-performing
teams and delivering enterprise software solutions. BS in Computer Science with
graduate-level coursework in Interactive Multimedia and Project Management.
[rest of summary...]

EDUCATION
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science                   May 2000
Southern Illinois University                              Carbondale, IL
```

### ❌ BAD (What to Avoid)

```
EDUCATION
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science                   May 2000
Southern Illinois University                              Carbondale, IL

Master of Arts, Interactive Multimedia                    Incomplete
Southern Illinois University                              Coursework Completed
```

## Why This Works

### For ATS Systems

- ✅ No "incomplete" keyword in Education section
- ✅ No red flag triggers
- ✅ Summary text is less strictly parsed
- ✅ "Graduate-level coursework" reads as additional qualification

### For Human Reviewers

- ✅ They see you did graduate work
- ✅ Shows commitment to learning
- ✅ Adds credibility (Interactive Multimedia + Project Management)
- ✅ No awkward "why didn't you finish?" questions
- ✅ Framed as bonus, not incomplete goal

### For Interviews

**If asked about it:**
"I completed all coursework for a Master's in Interactive Multimedia with a focus
on Project Management at SIU. The program was discontinued before I could defend
my thesis, but the coursework gave me valuable experience in [relevant skills].
I've applied those principles throughout my career, especially in [specific
examples from your work]."

**Key points:**

- Program discontinued (external factor, not your fault)
- Completed all coursework (you did the work)
- Applied the learning (practical value)
- Move on quickly (don't dwell on it)

## What You Gain

### Additional Credibility

- **Interactive Multimedia** - Shows early interest in UX/design/technology
- **Project Management** - Reinforces your management credentials
- **Graduate-level** - Shows intellectual curiosity and commitment

### Differentiators

Most Engineering Managers have:

- ✅ BS in Computer Science

You have:

About / Summary
[Include same line about graduate-level coursework]
```

**Don't:**

- List incomplete Master's in Education section
- Use "ABD" or "All But Dissertation"
- Say "incomplete" or "did not complete"

**Do:**

- Mention in summary as additional qualification
- Frame as "graduate-level coursework"
- Connect to relevant skills/experience

## Bottom Line

**You get credit for the work without the red flag.**

- ATS: ✅ Passes filters
- Humans: ✅ See additional education
- Interviews: ✅ No awkward questions
- Value: ✅ Shows commitment to learning

This is the smart way to handle incomplete graduate degrees on resumes.
