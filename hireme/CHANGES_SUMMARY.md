# Resume Changes Summary - People Management Focus

## What Changed and Why

### Problem Identified

Your original resume read too much like a **Senior Engineer** rather than an **Engineering Manager**. People management skills were buried or missing entirely.

### Solution Applied

Balanced technical depth with people management skills (50/50 split) and condensed older roles to avoid age signals.
