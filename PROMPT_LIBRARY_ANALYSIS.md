**Example**:

- "Generate 5 prompts for Engineering Managers using Template Pattern"
- "Generate 5 prompts for QA Engineers using Recipe Pattern"
- "Generate 5 prompts for Architects using Tree of Thought Pattern"

### 2. **Test Existing Prompts for Issues**

**Request**: "Review these prompts for clarity, effectiveness, and potential issues"

**Check For**:

- Ambiguous instructions
- Missing context
- Too broad/too narrow
- Pattern misalignment
- Role mismatch

### 3. **Add Missing Roles**

**Potential Roles to Add**:

- Data Scientists
- Security Engineers

## Sample Prompts by Pattern

### **Persona Pattern** (Current Default)

```
Act as a senior software architect. Review this code and provide:
1. Security issues
2. Performance concerns
3. Best practice violations
4. Suggestions for improvement
```

### **Few-Shot Pattern** (Need More)

```
Here are examples of good bug reports:

Example 1:
Title: Login button unresponsive on mobile Safari
Steps: 1) Open app on iPhone, 2) Tap login, 3) Nothing happens
Expected: Login form appears
Actual: Button doesn't respond

Example 2:
Title: API returns 500 on user creation
Steps: 1) POST to /api/users with valid data, 2) Check response
Expected: 201 Created
Actual: 500 Internal Server Error

Now write a bug report for: [your bug]
```

### **Template Pattern** (Need More)

````
Generate an API documentation using this template:

# [Endpoint Name]

## Overview
[Brief description]

## Request
- Method: [GET/POST/etc]
- URL: [endpoint]
- Headers: [required headers]

## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Description |

```

### **Chain of Thought** (Need More)
```

Let's debug this issue step by step:

1. First, identify the symptom: What is the unexpected behavior?
2. Then, form hypotheses: What are 3 possible causes?
3. Next, test the most likely hypothesis: What experiment can we run?
4. Analyze results: Did it prove or disprove our hypothesis?
5. Iterate: If disproven, test next hypothesis
6. Finally, identify root cause and fix

[Paste your bug description]

```

### **Recipe Pattern** (Need More)
```

To set up a CI/CD pipeline:

Step 1: Define your build stages

- What needs to be built?
- What tests need to run?
- What security scans are required?

Step 2: Configure your pipeline file

- Choose your CI tool (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Define triggers (on push, on PR, etc.)
- Set up environment variables

Step 3: Add deployment stages

- Define deployment environments (staging, production)
- Set up approval gates
- Configure rollback strategy

Step 4: Test and iterate

- Run a test deployment
- Monitor for issues
- Refine based on feedback

[Describe your project and I'll customize this recipe]

- Current: 10 roles, uneven distribution
- Goal: Add 3 roles, balance prompts

**Quality**:
- Target: All prompts tested with AI
- Current: Untested
- Goal: 100% tested and validated

**User Value**:
- Target: Users understand which pattern to use when
- Current: Patterns explained but not linked to prompts
