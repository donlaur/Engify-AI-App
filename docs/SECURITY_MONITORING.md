## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

Our security monitoring strategy follows defense-in-depth principles with multiple layers of automated scanning and manual review processes.

## ü§ñ Automated Security Scanning

### 1. Dependabot (GitHub)

**Frequency**: Weekly (Mondays at 9 AM)  
**Coverage**: npm, GitHub Actions, Python packages

**What it does**:

- Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Creates automated PRs for security updates
- Groups non-security updates for easier review
- Always separates security updates into individual PRs

**Configuration**: `.github/dependabot.yml`

### 2. CodeQL Analysis

**Frequency**: On every push and PR  
**Coverage**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python

**What it does**:

- Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- Detects common security patterns (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Runs extended security and quality queries
- Uploads results to GitHub Security tab

**Configuration**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

### 3. CVE Checking

**Frequency**: Daily at 3 AM UTC  
**Coverage**: All dependencies

**What it does**:

- Checks npm packages against CVE database
- Checks Python packages with Safety
- Optional: Snyk scanning (requires SNYK_TOKEN)
- Creates GitHub issues for high-severity vulnerabilities
- Fails build on critical vulnerabilities

**Configuration**: `.github/workflows/cve-check.yml`

### 4. Secret Scanning

**Frequency**: On every push and PR  
**Coverage**: Entire codebase and git history

**What it does**:

- Scans for accidentally committed secrets
- Uses TruffleHog for deep scanning
- Checks API keys, tokens, passwords
- Verifies secrets against known patterns

**Configuration**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

### 5. Dependency Review

**Frequency**: On every PR  
**Coverage**: Dependency changes

**What it does**:

- Reviews new dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Checks license compatibility
- Denies GPL-2.0 and GPL-3.0 licenses
- Fails on moderate+ severity vulnerabilities
- Comments summary in PR

**Configuration**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

### 6. OpenSSF Scorecard

**Frequency**: On every push to main  
**Coverage**: Repository security posture

**What it does**:

- Evaluates security best practices
- Checks for security policy, branch protection, etc.
- Provides security score (0-10)
- Uploads results to GitHub Security tab

**Configuration**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

## üìä Vulnerability Severity Levels

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)

**Response Time**: Immediate (within 24 hours)  
**Action**:

- Automated build failure
- Immediate notification
- Emergency patch or workaround
- Document in incident log

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)

**Response Time**: Within 7 days  
**Action**:

- GitHub issue created automatically
- Review and plan fix
- Update in next release cycle
- Monitor for exploitation

### Moderate (CVSS 4.0-6.9)

**Response Time**: Within 30 days  
**Action**:

- Track in backlog
- Include in regular updates
- Review during sprint planning

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)

**Response Time**: Within 90 days  
**Action**:

- Track for awareness
- Update when convenient
- May defer if low risk

## üîÑ Vulnerability Management Process

### 1. Detection

- Automated scans run daily
- Dependabot checks weekly
- Manual audits quarterly

### 2. Assessment

- Review severity and exploitability
- Check if vulnerability affects our usage
- Determine blast radius
- Assess risk to production

### 3. Prioritization

- Critical: Drop everything
- High: Next sprint
- Moderate: Backlog
- Low: Opportunistic

### 4. Remediation

- Update dependency (preferred)
- Apply patch or workaround
- Remove dependency if possible
- Accept risk if justified (document)

### 5. Verification

- Run tests after update
- Verify vulnerability is resolved
- Check for regressions
- Update documentation

### 6. Documentation

- Record in TECH_DEBT_AUDIT.md
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Close GitHub issue
- Update security scorecard

## üö® Incident Response

### When a Critical Vulnerability is Found

1. **Immediate Actions** (0-2 hours)
   - Assess if actively exploited
   - Determine if production is affected
   - Notify team immediately
   - Begin incident log

2. **Short-term** (2-24 hours)
   - Implement emergency patch or workaround
   - Deploy to production if affected
   - Monitor for exploitation attempts
   - Communicate with stakeholders

3. **Long-term** (1-7 days)
   - Implement permanent fix
   - Review similar code for same issue
   - Update security policies
   - Conduct post-mortem
