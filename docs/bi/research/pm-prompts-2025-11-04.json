Category: `general`\n  - Pattern: `recipe`\n  - Level: beginner\n  - Description: Generates a structured script for a product demo based on target audience and key features.\n  - Use Case: Preparing for product demos to showcase the value of the product.\n  - Gap Reason: Provides a template for effective product demos.\n\n### 2. Missing PM Categories\n\n- `Analytics`: Needed to encompass prompts related to product analytics, data analysis, and reporting. This is a very specific area within product management.\n\n### 3. Pattern Utilization\n\n- **Chain-of-Thought:** Valuable for PMs when exploring complex problems with multiple dependencies. For example, \"What are the potential cascading effects of delaying this feature?\"\n- **Cognitive Verifier:** Useful for validating product decisions against established frameworks or best practices. For example, \"Does this pricing strategy align with our overall market positioning?\" or using it to validate if the GTM strategy addresses key risks.\n- **Hypothesis Testing:** Beyond A/B tests, this pattern can be used for validating assumptions about user behavior or market trends. For example, \"How can we validate our hypothesis that users will prefer this new design?\"\n- **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing a competitor's product or strategy to understand their approach and identify potential weaknesses. For example, \"What are the key assumptions underlying this competitor's pricing model?\"\n- **Flipped Interaction:** This pattern can be used to simulate a conversation with a customer or stakeholder, allowing the PM to practice their communication skills and anticipate potential questions or objections.\n- **KERNEL Framework:** Can be applied to structure the definition and management of product initiatives.\n\n### 4. Level Distribution\n\n- Associate/Junior PM prompts: 6 missing\n- Mid-level PM prompts: 8 missing\n- Senior PM prompts: 4 missing\n- Director/VP PM prompts: 2 missing\n\n### 5. Research Insights\n\n- Insight 1: **We are heavily reliant on the `persona` pattern.** While useful, diversifying pattern usage can lead to more sophisticated and helpful prompts. Specifically, we need to incorporate more `recipe`, `chain-of-thought`, and `cognitive-verifier` patterns. This means creating more structured guides and prompts that simulate reasoning.\n- Insight 2: **There's a significant gap in prompts targeting mid-level PMs.** These prompts should focus on strategy execution, complex problem-solving, and cross-functional collaboration. This means prompts relating to GTM strategy, risk assessment, and prioritization.\n- Insight 3: **We are missing an 'Analytics' category.** Product analytics is a core function and requires its own dedicated category. This will help with discoverability and organization. We need prompts that help PMs define metrics, analyze data, and create dashboards.",
