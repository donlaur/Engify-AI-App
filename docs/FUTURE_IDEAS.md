## üöÄ Phase 7+: User-Generated Content Strategy

### Vision

Transform from curated library to community-driven platform with network effects.

### Phases

1. **Phase 2 (Post-Launch)**: User Submissions
   - "Submit a Prompt" feature
   - Admin approval queue
   - Quality guidelines
   - **Goal**: Learn what users want

2. **Phase 3 (Growth)**: Community Library
   - Public/private prompts
   - Upvoting/rating system
   - Search analytics
   - **Goal**: Network effects

3. **Phase 4 (Scale)**: Marketplace
   - Sell premium prompts
   - Revenue share (70/30)
   - Pro users get all
   - **Goal**: Monetization + retention

### Similar Platforms to Study

- **PromptBase**: Marketplace model, quality control
- **GitHub Gists**: User-generated, searchable
- **Stack Overflow**: Reputation system, gamification
- **Notion Templates**: Freemium gallery

### Data to Collect (Start Now!)

- Search queries ‚Üí What prompts are missing?
- Most viewed ‚Üí What's valuable?
- Most copied ‚Üí What works?
- User submissions ‚Üí What do they need?
- Failed searches ‚Üí Content gaps

### Red Hat Warnings

- UGC requires moderation (expensive)
- Quality control at scale is hard
- Need to validate users want to share first
- Don't build until we prove core value

## ü§ñ Claude Code Skills Integration

**Source**: [Egghead.io Course](https://egghead.io/create-your-first-claude-code-skill~sds93)
**Added**: 2025-10-27

### Concept

Create custom "Skills" for Claude to overcome limitations (e.g., current time, shell commands).

### Use Cases for Engify

1. **Prompt Testing Skills**
   - Execute prompts with real-time context
   - Access to current date/time for time-sensitive prompts
   - Shell command execution for DevOps prompts

2. **Custom Automation**
   - File structure: SKILL.md format
   - Description for discovery
   - allowed-tools for safe shell access

3. **Workbench Enhancement**
   - Give users ability to create custom skills
   - Safely execute prompts with real context
   - Turn failed requests into successful results

### Implementation Ideas

- **Phase 6**: Add skill creation to Pro tier
- **Phase 7**: Skill marketplace (users share skills)
- **Integration**: Workbench + Skills = powerful automation

### Next Steps (Later!)

1. Take the Egghead course
2. Prototype a timestamp skill
3. Design skill creation UI
4. Add to Pro feature set

## üéØ Current Focus

**WE ARE NOT BUILDING THESE NOW!**

Current: Phase 5 (126/150 commits)
Next: Fix build errors, finish MVP
Then: Launch, validate, collect data
Later: Pick from this list based on user feedback

**Remember**: Every shiny thing here is a distraction until we hit 150 commits and launch! üöÄ
