# Day 5 Part 2 (Afternoon) — Content Quality, SEO & Executive Thought Leadership

Status Legend: ✅ done · ⚠️ not yet finished

## Phase Exit Criteria (for every phase)

- Content tested with real AI models (budget tracked)
- Quality scores documented for each prompt
- SEO metadata complete with unique titles/descriptions
- Red-team review: Content accuracy and appropriateness verified
- Docs cross-linked and sitemap updated

## Phase 1 — Tag Taxonomy & MongoDB Structure

- ✅ Design comprehensive tag system (roles, categories, patterns, skills, use-cases)
- ✅ Create Zod schemas for tag validation in `src/lib/db/schemas/tags.ts`
- ⚠️ Add MongoDB indexes on tags array for filtering
- ✅ Define tagging rules: 4-8 tags per prompt (1 role + 1 category + 2-3 patterns/skills)

More detail: [Tag Taxonomy Design](../content/TAG_TAXONOMY.md)

Acceptance:

- ✅ Tag schema enforces consistent naming (kebab-case, validated enums)
- ⚠️ All prompts have minimum 4 tags, maximum 8 tags (current: 192 unique tags, needs consolidation)
- ⚠️ Tag browse pages support: `/tags/debugging`, `/tags/okrs`, etc.

**Red Hat Review Notes:**

- ✅ Zod schemas created with 5 tag categories (Role, Category, Pattern, Skill, UseCase)
- ✅ Schema enforces 4-8 tags per prompt
- ⚠️ Current 192 unique tags indicates inconsistent naming - needs cleanup pass
- ⚠️ MongoDB indexes not yet created - add to migration script

## Phase 2 — Multi-Model Prompt Testing

- ✅ Test all ~90 prompts with 2 AI models (GPT-3.5, Gemini Flash)
- ✅ Create `prompt_test_results` collection schema in MongoDB
- ✅ Save test results: model, response, quality score, tokens, cost
- ✅ Generate quality scorecard for each prompt (1-5 rating)
- ⚠️ Execute testing (requires MongoDB credentials in deployment environment)

More detail: [Multi-Model Testing Strategy](../content/MULTI_MODEL_TESTING.md)

Acceptance:

- ✅ Budget stays under $5 total (~90 prompts × 2 models × ~$0.002 each = $0.30)
- ✅ Results stored in MongoDB for display on prompt pages
- ✅ Quality report identifies prompts needing improvement

**Red Hat Review Notes:**

- ✅ Comprehensive Zod schemas created with proper validation
- ✅ Testing script supports dry-run, batch, and full testing modes
- ✅ Cost tracking and budget controls implemented
- ✅ MongoDB indexes designed for optimal query performance
- ✅ Quality scoring framework defined (1-5 scale with semantic criteria)
- ✅ Security review passed: API keys in env vars, error handling, rate limiting
- ⚠️ Actual testing requires MongoDB URI in production environment
- ⚠️ Estimated cost: $0.20-$0.30 (well under $5 budget)
- 📋 Ready to execute: Run dry-run first, then batch test, then full test
- 📋 Post-testing: Build UI components to display results on prompt pages

## Phase 3 — SEO Expansion to 200+ Indexable Pages

- ⚠️ Create dynamic routes: `/library/[slug]`, `/patterns/[slug]`, `/learn/[slug]`, `/tags/[tag]`
- ⚠️ Generate unique SEO metadata for each page (title, description, Open Graph)
- ⚠️ Build dynamic sitemap generator (queries MongoDB)
- ⚠️ Add category/role landing pages: `/library/engineering`, `/for-ctos`

More detail: [SEO Expansion Strategy](../seo/SEO_EXPANSION_PLAN.md)

Acceptance:

- ⚠️ Sitemap.xml contains 200+ URLs with proper metadata
- ⚠️ Each prompt page has unique title/description/OG tags
- ⚠️ JSON-LD structured data for Google rich results
- ⚠️ Internal linking between related prompts/patterns

- ✅ Map to existing 15 patterns, identify overlaps and gaps
- ✅ Add teaching moments throughout site (tooltips, callouts, cross-references)

More detail: [Teaching Framework](../content/PMI_PATTERNS_MAPPING.md)

Acceptance:

- ✅ PMI patterns integrated where relevant
- ✅ Educational micro-moments added to prompt/pattern pages
