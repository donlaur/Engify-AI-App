- ❌ **Add XSS sanitization** for user comments (security requirement)
- ❌ **Add error boundaries** to new components (UX requirement)

**Audit Report:** [Enterprise Compliance Audit](../ENTERPRISE_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_DAY5.md)

**Estimated Effort:** 12 hours

- ❌ Created duplicate provider code (violated DRY) - Caught and fixed
- ❌ Hardcoded model names (violated centralization) - Caught and fixed
- ❌ Missing tests (violated Day 3 testing standards) - **STILL NEEDS FIX**
- ❌ Missing organizationId (violated Day 4 multi-tenant) - **STILL NEEDS FIX**
- ✅ Security conscious (no secrets, env vars only)
- ✅ Zod validation throughout
- 📋 **Action:** Apply enterprise checklist to ALL new code before commit
