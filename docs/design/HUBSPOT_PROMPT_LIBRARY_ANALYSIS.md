# Professional Prompt Library Layout Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of professional prompt library organization patterns that can be adopted for Engify.ai.

## Key Features

### 1. Stage-Based Organization
- **4 Stages**: Express → Tailor → Amplify → Evolve
- Each stage has a clear description and purpose
- Prompts are organized by workflow stage, not just category

### 2. Sidebar Filtering
- **Filter by Stage** sidebar (left side)
- Shows all stages with counts
- Quick navigation between stages

### 3. Prompt Card Layout
- **Consistent naming**: Role + Tool (e.g., "Brand Differentiation Analyzer")
- **Stage badge** on each card (e.g., "1. Express")
- **Expand/Copy actions** on hover
- **Modal view** for full prompt details

### 4. Modal/Detail View
- Clean, professional modal overlay
- Shows structured prompt template:
  - `# ROLE` - Defines the AI persona
  - `# CONTEXT` - Sets the scenario
  - Structured sections with placeholders `[ ]`
- **Copy to clipboard** button prominent
- Close (X) button in top right

### 5. Professional Descriptions
- Each stage has rich description explaining:
  - What it's for
  - Why it matters
  - What prompts help with

### 6. Consistent Prompt Structure
All prompts follow this pattern:
```
# ROLE You are a [expert role] with expertise in [domain]...
# CONTEXT [scenario description]...
[Structured sections with placeholders]
```
