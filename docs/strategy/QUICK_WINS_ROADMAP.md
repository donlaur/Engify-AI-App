## Philosophy: Value vs. Effort Matrix

```
High Value │ BIG BETS        │ QUICK WINS ⭐
           │ (Plan carefully) │ (Do now!)
           │                 │
           ├─────────────────┼─────────────
           │                 │
Low Value  │ TIME SINKS      │ FILL-INS
           │ (Avoid!)        │ (When free)
           │                 │
           └─────────────────┴─────────────
             High Effort       Low Effort
```

**Focus**: Quick Wins quadrant (High Value, Low Effort)

---

### 3. Start Dogfooding (Internal Case Study)

**Value**: High - Credibility + data  
**Effort**: Low - Use our own product  
**Owner**: Entire team

**Tasks**:

**Technical**:

```typescript
// Pseudo-code
function validatePrompt(prompt: string, userId: string) {
  // 1. Sanitize
  const clean = sanitizeInput(prompt);

  // 2. Rate limit check
  if (exceedsRateLimit(userId)) {
    throw new RateLimitError();
  }

  // 3. Topic classification
  const topic = classifyTopic(clean);
  if (topic === 'blocked') {
    throw new InvalidTopicError();
  }

  // 4. Log
  auditLog.create({ userId, prompt: hash(clean), topic });

  return clean;
}
```

## What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

These are valuable but NOT quick wins. Save for later phases:

### Big Bets (High Value, High Effort)

- Agent Mode (human-on-the-loop) - Q2 2026
- GitHub Integration - Q2 2026
- Multi-agent workflows - Q3 2026
- SOC 2 certification - Q4 2026

### Fill-Ins (Low Value, Low Effort)

- Dark mode - Backlog
- Custom themes - Backlog
- Additional languages - Backlog

### Time Sinks (Low Value, High Effort)

- Custom LLM training - Avoid
- Mobile app - Not now
- Enterprise SSO (before we have enterprise customers) - Premature

---

## Review & Iterate

### Weekly Check-In (Every Monday)

- What did we complete?
- What's blocked?
- Do we need to reprioritize?

### 30-Day Review (Nov 25)

- Did we hit our targets?
- What was the actual effort vs. estimate?
- What did we learn?
- What are the next 30-day quick wins?

## Key Principle

> "Perfect is the enemy of done. Ship quick wins fast, learn, iterate."

- Don't over-engineer
- Ship → Measure → Learn → Improve
- 80% solution in 20% of time > 100% solution never shipped
- Quick wins build momentum for big bets
