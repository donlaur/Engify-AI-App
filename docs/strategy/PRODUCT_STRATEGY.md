# Product Strategy - Educational AI Platform

**Core Mission**: Teach developers and engineering leaders how to effectively use AI through curated prompts and guided learning.

**NOT**: An AI execution platform (yet)  
**YES**: An AI education and prompt library platform

---

## üéØ Product Vision

### What We Are (MVP - Year 1)

**An Educational Platform for AI Adoption**:
- Curated library of 100+ vetted prompts for engineering workflows
- Learning pathways to go from "AI Fear to AI Fluency"
- Interactive workbench to practice and refine prompts
- Copy-paste prompts that users run in their own AI tools
- Teaching best practices for prompt engineering

**Value Proposition**: "Learn how to use AI effectively for engineering and product work"

### What We're NOT (Yet)

**Not an AI execution platform**:
- ‚ùå Not running AI on behalf of users (initially)
- ‚ùå Not scanning codebases or repos
- ‚ùå Not integrating with GitHub/GitLab
- ‚ùå Not storing sensitive code
- ‚ùå Not requiring high-trust security

**Why**: These require significant security infrastructure, funding, and trust. We'll add them in Year 2+ when we have:
- SOC2 certification
- Enterprise customers
- Proven track record
- Funding for security infrastructure

## üìö Core Product Features

### 1. Prompt Playbooks (Library)

**What It Is**:
- 100+ curated prompts for different roles and scenarios
- Organized by role (Junior Eng, Senior Eng, PM, Manager, etc.)
- Each prompt is a template users can copy and customize

**How It Works**:
```
User Flow:
1. Browse prompts by role/category
2. Click on a prompt (e.g., "Code Review Co-Pilot")
3. Read the prompt template
4. Click "Copy to Clipboard"
5. Paste into ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini
6. Customize with their specific context
7. Get results
```

**Key Features**:
- Search and filter prompts
- Favorite prompts
- Rate prompts (helps us improve)
- Share prompts with team
- Track which prompts you've used

**Example Prompt**:
```
Title: "Pull Request Review Co-Pilot"
Category: Engineer: Mid-Level
Description: Helps you provide thorough, constructive, and empathetic 
feedback on a teammate's pull request.

Prompt:
Act as a Staff Engineer known for giving excellent, insightful, and 
kind code reviews. I'm about to review a pull request (PR) from a 
teammate, and I want your help to make my feedback as effective as 
possible.

I will provide the PR description and a code diff. You will analyze 
them and help me structure my review by suggesting feedback in three 
categories:
1. Praise (Start with the Positive)
2. Questions (Seek to Understand)
3. Suggestions (Offer Improvements)

--- PR DESCRIPTION ---
[User pastes their PR description here]

--- CODE DIFF ---
[User pastes their code diff here]
```

**User copies this, pastes into ChatGPT, fills in their specific PR details, and gets structured feedback.**

### 2. Learning Pathways (Guided Education)

**What It Is**:
- Curated learning journeys (e.g., "AI Strategy for Leaders")
- Step-by-step progression from beginner to advanced
- Mix of articles, prompts, and exercises

**Example Pathway**: "AI Strategy for Leaders"
```
Step 1: Read article - "How AI Is Impacting Engineering Leadership"
Step 2: Use prompt - "Draft AI Usage Policy for Your Team"
Step 3: Exercise - "Define AI Adoption OKRs"
Step 4: Read article - "AI Product Strategy"
Step 5: Use prompt - "Build Business Case for AI Investment"
```

**How It Works**:
- User selects a pathway
- Completes steps in order
- Tracks progress
- Gets certificate/badge when complete

### 3. AI Workbench (Interactive Learning)

**What It Is** (MVP Version):
- Interactive tools to practice prompt engineering
- Pre-built workflows for common tasks
- Copy-paste interface (not AI execution)

**Example Tools**:

#### Retrospective Diagnostician
```
User Flow:
1. User describes their retrospective scenario
2. Tool shows them a structured prompt template
3. User copies prompt
4. User pastes into their AI tool (ChatGPT/Claude)
5. User gets structured retrospective questions
6. User brings results back to their team
```

#### Tech Debt Strategist
```
User Flow:
1. User describes technical debt
2. Tool generates a business case prompt
3. User copies and runs in AI tool
4. User gets business case document
5. User shares with leadership
```

**Key Point**: We're teaching them HOW to use AI, not running AI for them.

### 4. Learning Hub (Curated Content)

**What It Is**:
- Curated articles about AI in engineering
- Best practices and case studies
- Community-contributed content

**Features**:
- Read articles
- Bookmark for later
- Share with team
- Discuss in comments (future)

## üö´ What We're NOT Building (Yet)

### Not in Phase 1 (Year 1)
- ‚ùå AI execution on our servers (users run their own)
- ‚ùå GitHub/GitLab integration
- ‚ùå Codebase scanning
- ‚ùå Automated code reviews
- ‚ùå Repository analysis
- ‚ùå CI/CD integration
- ‚ùå IDE plugins

### Why Not?
1. **Security**: Requires SOC2, high trust, significant infrastructure
2. **Funding**: Need capital for security infrastructure
3. **Focus**: Want to nail the education piece first
4. **Validation**: Prove people want to learn before building execution

### When We'll Add Them
- **Phase 2 (Year 2)**: AI execution with user's keys
- **Phase 3 (Year 3+)**: Code scanning after SOC2 + funding

---

## üí° Key Product Insights

### The Genius of This Approach

**1. Low Security Barrier**:
- No sensitive data = easier to launch
- No SOC2 required = lower costs
- Faster time to market

**2. Educational Value**:
- Teaching people HOW to use AI (not doing it for them)
- Builds understanding and skills
- Creates loyal users who trust us

**3. Natural Upgrade Path**:
- Start: Learn with copy-paste prompts
- Upgrade: Run prompts in our app (convenience)
- Enterprise: Integrate with codebase (power)

**4. Validation Before Investment**:
- Prove people want to learn
- Build community and trust
- Then invest in execution infrastructure

### The Challenge

**Perceived Value**:
- "Why pay for prompts I can copy-paste?"
- Need to emphasize: Curation, organization, learning pathways
- Value is in the EDUCATION, not just the prompts

**Solution**:
- Free tier: Prove value with basic prompts
- Pro tier: Advanced prompts, workbench tools, analytics
- Team tier: Collaboration and team learning
- Enterprise: Custom training and support

## üìù Updated Documentation Needed

Based on this clarification, we need to update:

1. **ARCHITECTURE_STRATEGY.md**: Remove AI execution infrastructure (for Phase 1)
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Focus on prompt library, not AI execution
3. **ENTERPRISE_STRATEGY.md**: Adjust security requirements (lower for Phase 1)
4. **SAAS_MODEL_OVERVIEW.md**: Update pricing based on education model

**Key Changes**:
- Phase 1: Education platform (low security requirements)
- Phase 2: Assisted execution (SOC2 required)
- Phase 3: Code intelligence (FedRAMP for government)

---

**This is a much smarter go-to-market strategy. Prove the education value first, then add execution capabilities.**
