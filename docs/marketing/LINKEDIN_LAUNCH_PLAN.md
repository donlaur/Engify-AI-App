### Option 1: Problem-Solution Focus

**Headline**: "Generic AI prompts don't work for enterprise teams. Here's what does."

**Post**:

I've spent the last 6 months researching how Engineering Managers, Product Managers, and other enterprise roles actually use AI.

The problem? Generic "Act as a [role]" prompts produce generic results. They don't solve the real problems teams face every day.

That's why I built Engify.ai — a library of 100+ specialized AI prompts and patterns designed for enterprise engineering and product teams.

🎯 **What Makes It Different:**

✅ **Role-Specific Solutions**: Each prompt solves a real problem (e.g., "Writing Performance Reviews" for EMs, "User Story Generation" for Product Owners)

✅ **Multi-Step Workflows**: These aren't one-shot prompts. They're structured workflows that guide you through complex tasks.

✅ **Audited & Enriched**: Every prompt is audited by AI agents across 8 categories (Completeness, SEO, Enterprise Readiness, Security, etc.)

✅ **Comprehensive Landing Pages**: Each role has a dedicated page explaining:
- What the role does
- How AI transforms their work
- Common problems & AI solutions
- Real-life examples

**For Engineering Managers:**
- Performance Review Synthesizer
- Empathetic Scriptwriter (for difficult conversations)
- Delegation & Context Engine
- SDLC Analyst (workflow bottlenecks)

**For Product Managers:**
- Stakeholder Alignment Bot
- User Research Analyst
- Roadmap Generator
- AI Market Researcher

**For Product Owners:**
- Story Generation Tool
- AC Interviewer (Flipped Interaction Pattern)
- Backlog Grooming Assistant

**For Engineers:**
- AI Debugging Partner (distributed systems)
- Code Archaeologist (legacy code)
- TDD Bot (test-first development)
- AI Review Buddy

**For DevOps/SRE:**
- IaC Generator
- Incident Co-Pilot
- CI/CD Pipeline Analyzer

**For QA Engineers:**
- Test Case Generator
- Bug Report Formatter
- Flaky Test Analyzer

**For Designers:**
- Qualitative Data Analyst
- Persona Generator
- UX Writing Assistant
- AI Handoff Specialist

### Option 2: Story-Driven Approach

**Headline**: "I analyzed 270 industry reports to build AI prompts that actually work for enterprise teams"

**Post**:

6 months ago, I noticed something: Everyone is using AI, but few are getting real value from it.

The problem? Generic prompts don't solve specific problems.

So I did something different: I analyzed 270+ industry reports, technical docs, and practitioner forums to identify the biggest pain points for 7 enterprise roles.

Then I built specialized AI prompt workflows that solve those problems.

**The Result:**

100+ prompts across 7 roles:
- Engineering Managers
- Product Managers
- Product Owners
- Senior Software Engineers
- DevOps/SRE Engineers
- QA Engineers
- Product Designers

**Each prompt is:**
✅ Designed to solve a real problem (not generic advice)
✅ Audited by AI agents across 8 quality categories
✅ Enriched with SEO content, case studies, examples
✅ Part of a structured workflow (not just "copy and paste")

**Example: Engineering Manager Prompt**

Problem: Writing performance reviews takes 4+ hours and often misses important themes.

Solution: "Review Synthesizer" workflow that:
1. Analyzes self-review, projects, and peer feedback
2. Identifies key themes and behavioral examples
3. Generates sections based on competency models
4. Helps refine tone and create SMART goals

Result: 4 hours → 15 minutes, with better quality.

**We built comprehensive landing pages for each role:**

Each page explains:
- What the role does
- How AI transforms their work
- 5 common problems with AI solutions
- Real-life examples
- Daily tasks
- Use cases
