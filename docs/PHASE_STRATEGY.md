## üöÄ Phase 1: Education Platform (Year 1)

### What We Build

**Core Features**:
1. **Prompt Library** - 100+ curated, copy-paste prompts
2. **Learning Pathways** - Guided learning journeys
3. **Basic Workbench** - Prompt templates and generators
4. **Learning Hub** - Curated articles and resources
5. **User Accounts** - Save favorites, track progress

### How It Works

```
User Journey:
1. User signs up (free or paid)
2. User browses prompt library
3. User finds relevant prompt (e.g., "Code Review Co-Pilot")
4. User clicks "Copy to Clipboard"
5. User opens ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini
6. User pastes prompt + their context
7. User gets results
8. User rates the prompt
```

**Key Point**: We DON'T run AI. We teach users how to run it themselves.

### What We Store

**User Data**:
- Email, name, password (hashed)
- Profile information

## üí° Key Strategic Insights

### Why This Phased Approach Works

**1. Prove Value First**:
- Phase 1: Prove people want AI education
- Phase 2: Prove people want convenience
- Phase 3: Prove people want code intelligence

**2. Manage Risk**:
- Start with low security requirements
- Build trust before handling sensitive data
- Invest in security only when revenue justifies it

**3. Capital Efficient**:
- Phase 1: $0-50K to launch
- Phase 2: $50K-150K for SOC2
- Phase 3: $500K-1M for FedRAMP

**4. Natural Upgrade Path**:
- Free users ‚Üí Pro (convenience)
- Pro users ‚Üí Team (collaboration)
- Team users ‚Üí Enterprise (code intelligence)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Don't Skip Phase 1**:
- ‚ùå "Let's just build code scanning from day one"
- ‚úÖ Prove education value first, then add execution

**Don't Rush to Phase 3**:
- ‚ùå "We need FedRAMP to compete"
- ‚úÖ Get SOC2 first, FedRAMP only if customers demand it

**Don't Over-Build**:
- ‚ùå "Let's build all three phases at once"
- ‚úÖ Ship Phase 1, validate, then build Phase 2
