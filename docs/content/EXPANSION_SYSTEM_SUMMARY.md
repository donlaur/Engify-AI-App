## System Features

### 1. Gap Analysis ‚úÖ
Analyzes your existing 90 prompts and identifies:
- **Missing roles** (e.g., SRE, ML Engineer, Principal Engineer, Solutions Architect)
- **Underserved categories** (security has only 5 prompts, ML/Data has 3)
- **Complexity gaps** (too many beginner, not enough expert-level)

**Example Output:**
```
üìä ANALYZING EXISTING PROMPT LIBRARY
‚úÖ Total prompts: 90
‚úÖ Existing roles: 12
‚ö†Ô∏è  Missing roles (18):
   - site-reliability-engineer
   - principal-engineer
   - ml-engineer
   - solutions-architect
   - security-engineer
   ...
```

### 2. Intelligent Prompt Generation ‚úÖ
- Uses **GPT-4o** to generate 20+ new prompts per run
- Each prompt is **80-90% complete** (user customizes 10-20%)
- **Avoids duplication** by analyzing all existing prompts
- Targets **specific roles** and **real engineering problems**
- Includes structure, examples, and clear instructions

**Example Generated Prompt:**
```
Title: "Kubernetes Pod Crash Investigation"
Role: site-reliability-engineer
Category: debugging
Framework: Chain-of-Thought (step-by-step reasoning)
Model: GPT-4o ($0.005/call)
Red-Hat Score: 8.5/10 ‚≠ê FEATURED

Content: "You are an SRE investigating a Kubernetes pod crash...
[Includes: Detection steps, log analysis, common causes, mitigation strategies]"
```

### 3. Prompt Framework Recommendations ‚úÖ
**Teaching moment on EVERY prompt:**

| Framework | Best For | When to Use |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **CRAFT** | Simple tasks, templates | "Generate API endpoint" |
| **KERNEL** | High-stakes, enterprise | "Production incident plan" |
| **Chain-of-Thought** | Debugging, analysis | "Find performance bottleneck" |
| **Few-Shot** | Consistent format | "Generate tests matching style" |
| **Zero-Shot** | Brainstorming | "Propose 5 architecture options" |
| **Persona** | Domain expertise | "As security expert, review code" |

**Why it matters:**
- Users **learn** which framework works for their problem
- System **automatically selects** the best framework per prompt
- **Explains reasoning**: "Chain-of-Thought is best here because..."

### 4. AI Model Recommendations ‚úÖ
**Prevents overkill and saves money:**

| Model | Cost | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| **GPT-4o-mini** | $0.0001 | Simple formatting, basic tasks |
| **GPT-4o** | $0.005 | Complex code, architecture ‚úÖ MOST USED |
| **GPT-4-turbo** | $0.01 | Large codebases (128K context) |
| **o1-preview** | $0.15 | ONLY for critical bugs, algorithms ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | $0.003 | Great at following instructions |
| **Gemini Flash** | $0.00015 | Batch processing, extremely cheap |

**Cost Optimization Examples:**
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Use $0.15 o1-preview for "format JSON" (overkill!)
- ‚úÖ **DO:** Use $0.0001 gpt-4o-mini for "format JSON"
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Use $0.0001 gpt-4o-mini for "debug distributed system" (too complex!)
- ‚úÖ **DO:** Use $0.005 gpt-4o for "debug distributed system"

**Teaching Widget (Shows on Each Prompt):**
```
üí° RECOMMENDED MODEL: GPT-4o ($0.005/call)

Why? This debugging task is complex enough to justify the cost.
Using gpt-4o-mini would save $0.0049 but reduce quality.

For 100 uses/month:
  gpt-4o-mini:  $0.01/month  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Lower quality
  gpt-4o:       $0.50/month  ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
  o1-preview:   $15.00/month ‚ö†Ô∏è  Overkill!
```

### 5. Red-Hat Review System ‚úÖ
**Every prompt gets 4 scores (1-10):**

#### Score 1: Skill Level
*How specialized is the knowledge?*
- 1-3: Any engineer can use
- 4-7: Needs some experience
- 8-10: Expert-level only

**Example:**
- "Format JSON" ‚Üí 2/10 (beginner-friendly)
- "K8s troubleshooting" ‚Üí 7/10 (needs K8s knowledge)
- "Design consensus algorithm" ‚Üí 10/10 (experts only)

#### Score 2: Role Specificity
*How role-specific is this?*
- 1-3: General use (all roles)
- 4-7: Somewhat role-specific
- 8-10: Very role-specific

**Example:**
- "Write docs" ‚Üí 3/10 (any role)
- "Sprint retro" ‚Üí 7/10 (managers, leads)
- "Write PIP" ‚Üí 10/10 (eng managers ONLY)

#### Score 3: Usefulness
*Does AI significantly help?*
- 1-3: Easy manually, minimal benefit
- 4-7: Moderate help
- 8-10: AI essential, major improvement

**Example:**
- "Add TODO comment" ‚Üí 2/10 (faster to type manually)
- "Generate test cases" ‚Üí 7/10 (AI saves time)
- "Multi-step incident response" ‚Üí 9/10 (AI essential)

#### Score 4: Optimization
*Is prompt well-structured?*
- 1-3: Vague, poorly structured
- 4-7: Decent but could improve
- 8-10: Excellent structure, clear, examples

**Example:**
- "Write code" ‚Üí 2/10 (too vague!)
- "Write a function that..." ‚Üí 6/10 (decent)
- "Write TypeScript function with [examples, tests, edge cases]" ‚Üí 9/10 (excellent!)

#### Overall Score
*Average of all 4 scores*
- **8-10**: ‚≠ê Featured (auto-displayed first)
- **6-8**: Good quality, add to library
- **4-6**: Needs improvement
- **<4**: Reject, regenerate

**Real Example:**
```
üèÜ Production Database Incident Response
Red-Hat Score: 9.2/10 ‚≠ê FEATURED

‚îú‚îÄ Skill Level: 9/10 (expert SRE knowledge)
‚îú‚îÄ Role Specificity: 10/10 (SRE/DevOps only)
‚îú‚îÄ Usefulness: 9/10 (AI essential for thoroughness)
‚îú‚îÄ Optimization: 9/10 (excellent structure + examples)
‚îî‚îÄ Overall: 9.3/10

Reasoning: "Exceptionally well-structured with detection, triage,
mitigation, and post-mortem sections. Includes concrete examples
for replication lag, connection pool exhaustion, disk I/O. KERNEL
framework ensures all guardrails in place. Perfect for high-stakes
production incidents."

Decision: ‚úÖ Add to library, mark as featured
```

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Analyze Existing Library**
```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/content/expand-prompt-library.ts --analyze
```
- Scans all 90 existing prompts
- Identifies missing roles (18 found)
- Finds underserved categories (security, ML, testing)
- Detects complexity gaps

**2. Generate New Prompts**
```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/content/expand-prompt-library.ts --generate=20
```
For each of 20 prompts:
- AI generates prompt targeting a gap
- System determines best framework (CRAFT, KERNEL, etc.)
- System determines best model (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
- Red-hat reviews and scores (1-10 on 4 criteria)
- If score >= 8: Mark as featured
- If score >= 6: Add to library
- If score < 6: Reject, regenerate

**3. Save to MongoDB**
- Saves all high-quality prompts (score >= 6)
- Includes framework/model recommendations
- Includes all red-hat scores and reasoning
- Ready to display in UI

**Cost per Run:**
- 20 prompts √ó $0.0075/prompt = **$0.15 total**
- GPT-4o for generation ($0.005/prompt)
- GPT-4o-mini for reviews ($0.0025/prompt)

## Usage Examples

### Dry Run (Test First)
```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/content/expand-prompt-library.ts --dry-run --generate=5
```
**Cost:** $0.04 (5 prompts)  
**Result:** Shows what would be generated, doesn't save

### Generate 20 Production Prompts
```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/content/expand-prompt-library.ts --generate=20
```
**Cost:** $0.15  
**Result:** 20 new prompts saved to MongoDB  
**Expected:** 12-15 featured prompts (score >= 8)

### Full Analysis + Generation
```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/content/expand-prompt-library.ts --full
```
**Cost:** $0.15  
**Result:** Complete cycle (analyze + generate + save)

### Weekly Automated Run
```bash
# Cron: Every Monday at 9am, generate 10 prompts
0 9 * * 1 pnpm exec tsx scripts/content/expand-prompt-library.ts --generate=10
```
**Cost:** $0.08/week = **$0.32/month**
