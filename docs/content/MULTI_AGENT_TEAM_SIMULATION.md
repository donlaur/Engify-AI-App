# Multi-Agent Team Simulation Pattern

**Purpose**: Simulate realistic team discussions with AI agents playing different roles  
**Category**: Advanced Prompt Pattern (Level 4-5)  
**Use Case**: Decision-making, planning, learning how different roles think  
**Date**: October 29, 2025

---

## The Concept

Instead of asking ONE AI for advice, you orchestrate a **conversation between multiple AI agents**, each playing a different role:

- üîß **Engineer Agent**: Technical feasibility, implementation details
- üèóÔ∏è **Architect Agent**: System design, scalability, technical debt
- üíº **Director Agent**: Budget, resources, business impact
- üìã **Product Manager Agent**: Customer needs, market fit, priorities
- üë®‚Äçüíº **Tech Lead Agent**: Timeline, team capacity, risk assessment
- üé® **Designer Agent**: UX implications, user impact
- üß™ **QA Agent**: Testing requirements, quality concerns

**The Magic**: They challenge each other, surface issues, and converge on better solutions.

---

## Why This Works

### Traditional Approach (Single AI)

```
You: "Should we build feature X?"
AI: "Yes, here are 5 reasons why..."
```

**Problem**: One-sided, no critical thinking, misses blind spots

### Multi-Agent Approach

```
You: "Should we build feature X?"

Engineer: "Technically feasible, about 2 weeks"
Architect: "Wait - this will require a new microservice"
Director: "New service = $5K/month in infrastructure"
PM: "Do customers actually want this? Let me check data..."
Tech Lead: "2 weeks is optimistic, more like 4 with testing"
QA: "We'll need integration tests, add 1 week"

Final consensus: "Maybe start with MVP using existing service"
```

**Result**: Realistic, well-rounded, surfaces hidden costs

---

## Pattern 1: Sequential Review (Simple)

### How It Works

Each agent reviews the idea **one at a time**, building on previous feedback.

### Prompt Template

```
I want to evaluate an idea using a multi-agent team simulation.

Here's my idea:
[YOUR IDEA]

Please simulate a team discussion with these roles reviewing it sequentially:

1. ENGINEER (Technical Feasibility)
   - Can this be built?
   - What's the technical approach?
   - Estimated effort?

2. ARCHITECT (System Design)
   - How does this fit our architecture?
   - Any scalability concerns?
   - Technical debt implications?

3. DIRECTOR (Business & Budget)
   - What's the cost (infrastructure, people)?
   - What's the ROI?
   - Resource allocation concerns?

4. PRODUCT MANAGER (Customer & Market)
   - Do customers want this?
   - Does it fit our roadmap?
   - What's the priority vs. other features?

5. TECH LEAD (Execution)
   - Realistic timeline?
   - Team capacity?
   - Risk factors?

6. QA ENGINEER (Quality)
   - Testing requirements?
   - Quality concerns?
   - Edge cases to consider?

For each role:
- Start with their perspective
- Reference what previous roles said
- Raise concerns or validate points
- Suggest modifications

End with a CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION.
```

### Example Output

```
üí° IDEA: Add real-time collaboration to our document editor

üîß ENGINEER:
Technically feasible using WebSockets. We'd need:
- Socket.io or similar library
- Redis for pub/sub
- Conflict resolution algorithm (Operational Transform or CRDT)
Estimated effort: 2-3 weeks for MVP

üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECT:
Hold on - this changes our architecture significantly.
- Current: Stateless REST API
- New: Stateful WebSocket connections
- Concerns:
  * Need sticky sessions or Redis adapter
  * Horizontal scaling becomes complex
  * New infrastructure: Redis cluster
- Recommendation: Start with polling (simpler), then upgrade to WebSockets
- Revised effort: 1 week for polling MVP, 3 weeks for WebSocket upgrade

üíº DIRECTOR:
Let's talk costs:
- Redis cluster: $200/month (managed service)
- Increased server load: +2 instances = $400/month
- Engineering time: 3 weeks = $15K (loaded cost)
- Total first year: $22K

Questions:
- What's the revenue impact?
- How many users requested this?
- Can we charge premium for this feature?

üìã PRODUCT MANAGER:
Customer data:
- 47 users requested real-time collab (out of 5,000)
- Top request is actually "better search" (230 users)
- Competitive analysis: 3/5 competitors have this

My take:
- Nice-to-have, not must-have
- Could be differentiator for enterprise tier
- Suggest: Add to Q2 roadmap, not Q1
- Priority: 6/10

üë®‚Äçüíº TECH LEAD:
Timeline reality check:
- Architect's polling approach: 1 week ‚úÖ (realistic)
- WebSocket upgrade: 3 weeks is optimistic
  * Need to account for: Testing, edge cases, load testing
  * Realistic: 4-5 weeks
- Team capacity: We have 2 engineers available
- Risk: High complexity, could delay other features

Recommendation:
- Phase 1: Polling MVP (1 week)
- Measure usage
- Phase 2: WebSocket (if validated) - Q2

üß™ QA ENGINEER:
Testing concerns:
- Conflict resolution is HARD to test
- Need to simulate:
  * Multiple users editing same section
  * Network latency
  * Connection drops
  * Race conditions
- Testing effort: 1 week minimum
- Recommend: Extensive beta testing before GA

---

üéØ CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION:

‚úÖ BUILD: Polling-based MVP (1 week)
‚è∏Ô∏è DEFER: Full WebSocket implementation to Q2
üí∞ COST: ~$15K (eng time) + $200/month (Redis)
üìä PRIORITY: Medium (6/10)
üé¨ NEXT STEPS:
1. Build polling MVP
2. Beta test with 50 users
3. Measure engagement
4. Decide on WebSocket upgrade based on data

‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS SURFACED:
- Complexity underestimated (Tech Lead)
- Cost not justified by demand (Director + PM)
- Testing will be extensive (QA)

üí° BETTER APPROACH:
Start small (polling), validate demand, then invest in full solution.
```

---

## Pattern 2: Debate Mode (Advanced)

### How It Works

Agents **challenge each other** in real-time, like a real meeting.

### Prompt Template

```
Simulate a team meeting where these roles DEBATE this idea:

IDEA: [YOUR IDEA]

ROLES:
- Engineer (optimistic about tech)
- Architect (cautious about complexity)
- Director (focused on ROI)
- PM (customer-first)
- Tech Lead (realistic about timelines)

RULES:
1. Each agent speaks 2-3 times
2. They respond to each other's points
3. They can disagree and push back
4. Conversation should feel natural
5. End with consensus or vote

Format as a meeting transcript:
[ROLE]: "Statement..."
[ROLE]: "Response to previous point..."
```

### Example Output

```
üé¨ TEAM MEETING: Should we add AI-powered code review?

ENGINEER: "This is awesome! We can use GPT-4 to auto-review PRs.
I've seen demos - it catches bugs, style issues, even suggests
improvements. Implementation is straightforward - GitHub Actions
webhook, call OpenAI API, post comments. Maybe 1 week of work."

ARCHITECT: "Whoa, slow down. 'Straightforward' is doing a lot of
work there. You're talking about giving an external AI access to
our entire codebase. That's a MASSIVE security concern. We'd need:
- Code sanitization (remove secrets, API keys)
- Rate limiting (OpenAI API isn't free)
- Fallback if API is down
- Privacy review for proprietary code
This is more like 3-4 weeks, not 1."

DIRECTOR: "Let's talk numbers. OpenAI API for code review:
- Average PR: 500 lines
- Cost per review: ~$0.50
- We do 200 PRs/month
- That's $100/month... wait, that's actually cheap.
But Architect's point about 4 weeks of eng time = $12K.
What's the ROI? How much time does this actually save?"

PM: "I talked to our engineering team last week. Their #1 pain
point is PR review bottleneck - PRs sit for 2-3 days. But they
want HUMAN review, not AI. They're worried AI will:
- Miss context
- Give false positives
- Slow them down with noise
Maybe we're solving the wrong problem?"

TECH LEAD: "PM is right. I've used AI code review tools - they're
noisy. 80% of suggestions are 'consider adding a comment here' or
'this could be more concise.' Our team will ignore it after week 1.

What if we scope this down:
- AI only checks for security issues (SQL injection, XSS)
- AI only checks for test coverage gaps
- Humans still do architecture/logic review
That's actually valuable AND less controversial."

ENGINEER: "Okay, I can get behind that. Security-focused AI review
is less controversial. And we can use a specialized model like
Snyk or GitHub's CodeQL instead of general GPT-4."

ARCHITECT: "Much better. CodeQL is designed for this, has better
security, and GitHub already has access to our code. Implementation
drops to 1 week - just configure rules and test."

DIRECTOR: "CodeQL is free for open source, $21/user/month for
private repos. We have 10 devs = $210/month. Still cheaper than
I thought. If it catches even ONE security bug, it pays for itself."

PM: "I like this pivot. Security is non-negotiable, so team won't
push back. And it's not trying to replace human review, just
augment it. Let me validate: would the team actually USE this?"

TECH LEAD: "Yes. Security checks are objective, not subjective.
And we're already doing manual security reviews - this just
automates it. Timeline: 1 week setup, 1 week testing, 2 weeks
rollout. Total: 1 month."

---

üó≥Ô∏è VOTE:
‚úÖ Engineer: Yes (with security scope)
‚úÖ Architect: Yes (CodeQL approach)
‚úÖ Director: Yes (ROI is clear)
‚úÖ PM: Yes (team will use it)
‚úÖ Tech Lead: Yes (realistic timeline)

UNANIMOUS: Proceed with security-focused AI code review using CodeQL

üìã NEXT STEPS:
1. Tech Lead: Set up CodeQL trial
2. Engineer: Configure security rules
3. PM: Communicate to team
4. Director: Approve $210/month budget
5. All: Review after 30 days
```

---

## Pattern 3: Red Team / Blue Team

### How It Works

Split agents into **advocates** (Blue Team) and **critics** (Red Team).

### Prompt Template

```
Simulate a Red Team / Blue Team exercise:

IDEA: [YOUR IDEA]

BLUE TEAM (Advocates):
- Engineer: Why this is technically sound
- PM: Why customers need this
- Designer: Why UX will be great

RED TEAM (Critics):
- Architect: What could go wrong technically
- Director: Why this might not be worth it
- QA: What will break

Each team makes their case, then they debate.
End with a judge (Tech Lead) making final call.
```

---

## Pattern 4: Role-Playing Scenarios

### Teach Users How Different Roles Think

```
I want to learn how a [ROLE] thinks about [TOPIC].

Please simulate a [ROLE] reviewing this idea:
[YOUR IDEA]

Show me:
1. What questions they ask first
2. What they care about most
3. What red flags they look for
4. How they communicate their concerns
5. What a good outcome looks like for them

Be realistic - include their biases, constraints, and priorities.
```

**Example**:

```
ROLE: Engineering Director
TOPIC: Adopting new JavaScript framework

DIRECTOR'S THOUGHT PROCESS:

First Questions:
- "What problem does this solve that we can't solve now?"
- "What's the migration cost?"
- "How does this affect our hiring?"

What I Care About:
- Team productivity (will this speed us up or slow us down?)
- Risk (what if this framework dies in 2 years?)
- Cost (training, migration, maintenance)
- Hiring (can we find engineers who know this?)

Red Flags:
- "It's newer/cooler" (not a business reason)
- "Everyone is using it" (bandwagon fallacy)
- "It'll make us more modern" (vague)
- No migration plan
- Underestimated effort

Good Outcome:
- Clear ROI (faster development, better performance)
- Gradual migration path (not big bang)
- Team buy-in (they want to learn it)
- Proven in production (not bleeding edge)
- Hiring advantage (easier to recruit)

My Response:
"I like the idea, but I need to see:
1. Proof of concept (build one feature with it)
2. Migration plan (how do we move 100 components?)
3. Training plan (how do we upskill 10 engineers?)
4. Timeline (realistic, not optimistic)
5. Rollback plan (what if it doesn't work?)

Let's do a 2-week spike, then decide."
```

## Implementation in Engify.ai

### As Prompt Patterns (Not Standalone Tools)

These are **teaching tools** that show users how to:

1. Write prompts that simulate team discussions
2. Get multi-perspective feedback from AI
3. Surface blind spots in their thinking
4. Learn how different roles approach problems

### User Flow

1. **User selects pattern**: "Multi-Agent Team Simulation"
2. **User inputs idea**: "Add real-time collaboration"
3. **Engify.ai shows prompt template**: Pre-filled, ready to copy
4. **User runs in AI Workbench**: Test across providers
5. **User sees multi-agent discussion**: Learn from different perspectives
6. **User provides feedback**: "Was this helpful?"

### Integration with Existing Features

**Workbench Enhancement**:

```typescript
// New pattern category
{
  id: 'multi-agent-team-sim',
  name: 'Multi-Agent Team Simulation',
  category: 'strategic_planning',
  level: 4,
  description: 'Simulate team discussions with AI agents playing different roles',

  template: `I want to evaluate an idea using a multi-agent team simulation...`,

  variables: [
    { name: 'idea', label: 'Your Idea', type: 'textarea' },
    { name: 'roles', label: 'Roles to Include', type: 'multiselect',
      options: ['Engineer', 'Architect', 'Director', 'PM', 'Tech Lead', 'Designer', 'QA'] }
  ],

  providers: ['openai-gpt4', 'anthropic-claude'], // Works best with advanced models
}
```

---

## Learning Outcomes

### What Users Learn

1. **Prompt Engineering**: How to structure complex, multi-turn prompts
2. **Role Perspectives**: How different roles think and prioritize
3. **Decision-Making**: How to surface hidden costs and risks
4. **Communication**: How to present ideas to different stakeholders
5. **Critical Thinking**: How to challenge your own assumptions

### Progression

**Level 3**: Sequential Review (simple, one agent at a time)  
**Level 4**: Debate Mode (agents interact)  
**Level 5**: Custom Scenarios (user defines roles, constraints)

---

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement

- Pattern usage: Track completions
- Time spent: Avg 10-15 minutes
- Return usage: 40%+ (high value)

### Learning Effectiveness

- Survey: "Did this help you see blind spots?" (target: 85% yes)
- Survey: "Do you understand how [ROLE] thinks better?" (target: 80% yes)
- Survey: "Would you use this for real decisions?" (target: 70% yes)

### Business Value

- Premium feature: Level 4-5 (paid tier)
- Differentiation: No competitor has this
- Viral potential: Users share interesting debates

---

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Feature Prioritization

"Should we build feature X or Y?"
‚Üí Agents debate ROI, effort, customer impact

### 2. Technical Decisions

"Should we use microservices or monolith?"
‚Üí Agents discuss scalability, complexity, cost

### 3. Hiring Decisions

"Should we hire specialist or generalist?"
‚Üí Agents weigh team needs, budget, growth

### 4. Process Changes

"Should we adopt Scrum or Kanban?"
‚Üí Agents consider team size, project type, culture

### 5. Learning Tool

"How would a Director evaluate this proposal?"
‚Üí User learns to think like a Director

---

## Advanced Variations

### 1. Time-Boxed Debate

"Simulate a 15-minute standup where team debates this"

### 2. Consensus Building

"Keep debating until all agents agree or identify blockers"

### 3. Scenario Planning

"What if budget is cut 50%? How do agents adapt?"

### 4. Role Reversal

"Engineer argues AGAINST technical solution, PM argues FOR it"

### 5. Historical Replay

"Simulate how team would have evaluated iPhone in 2006"

---

## Technical Implementation

### How It Actually Works (Simulated Agents)

**Important**: These are NOT real separate AI agents. It's **one AI model role-playing different personas** in a single prompt.

```typescript
// CURRENT APPROACH: Single AI, Multiple Personas
// One API call, AI simulates all roles

const multiAgentPattern = {
  id: 'multi-agent-sim',
  prompt: (idea: string, roles: string[]) => `
    You are simulating a team meeting. Play ALL of these roles:
    ${roles.map((role) => `- ${role}: ${getRoleContext(role)}`).join('\n')}
    
    IDEA TO DISCUSS:
    ${idea}
    
    Simulate a realistic team discussion where:
    1. Each role speaks from their perspective
    2. Roles reference and respond to each other
    3. Roles can disagree and push back
    4. Conversation feels natural (not robotic)
    5. End with consensus or vote
    
    Format as meeting transcript:
    [ROLE NAME]: "What they say..."
  `,
};

function getRoleContext(role: string): string {
  const contexts = {
    engineer:
      'Focus on technical feasibility, implementation details, effort estimation',
    architect:
      'Focus on system design, scalability, technical debt, long-term implications',
    director: 'Focus on budget, ROI, resource allocation, business impact',
    pm: 'Focus on customer needs, market fit, prioritization, user data',
    tech_lead: 'Focus on realistic timelines, team capacity, risk assessment',
    designer: 'Focus on UX implications, user impact, design complexity',
    qa: 'Focus on testing requirements, quality concerns, edge cases',
  };
  return contexts[role] || '';
}

// User runs this in existing AI Workbench
// No new backend, no agent orchestration, no complexity!
```

### Why This Works

**Single Prompt = All Roles**:

- AI is good at role-playing multiple personas
- Cheaper (1 API call vs 6)
- Faster (no sequential waiting)
- Simpler (no orchestration logic)
- Same educational value

**Example Prompt**:

```
You are simulating a team meeting. Play ALL of these roles:

- ENGINEER: Focus on technical feasibility, implementation, effort
- ARCHITECT: Focus on system design, scalability, technical debt
- DIRECTOR: Focus on budget, ROI, business impact
- PM: Focus on customer needs, market fit, priorities

IDEA TO DISCUSS:
"Add real-time collaboration to our document editor"

Simulate a realistic team discussion where each role speaks 2-3 times,
they respond to each other's points, and they can disagree.

Format as meeting transcript.
```

**AI Output**:

```
ENGINEER: "This is doable with WebSockets. I'd estimate 2 weeks..."

ARCHITECT: "Hold on - WebSockets means we need sticky sessions.
That complicates our stateless architecture. We'd need Redis..."

DIRECTOR: "Redis cluster is $200/month. What's the ROI on this?"

PM: "Only 47 users requested this. Our top request is better
search with 230 votes. Should we prioritize that instead?"

ENGINEER: "Fair point. What if we start with polling instead of
WebSockets? That's simpler and we can upgrade later."

ARCHITECT: "Much better. Polling keeps our architecture stateless.
I can support that."

DIRECTOR: "Polling is cheaper too. What's the new timeline?"

ENGINEER: "1 week for polling MVP."

PM: "Let's do polling MVP, measure usage, then decide on WebSockets."

CONSENSUS: Build polling MVP (1 week), defer WebSocket to Q2.
```

### Future: Real Multi-Agent (Optional)

If we want TRUE agents (separate API calls, actual debate):

```typescript
// FUTURE APPROACH: Real Agents (More Complex)
// Multiple API calls, agents "listen" to each other

async function runRealMultiAgentSim(idea: string) {
  const agents = ['engineer', 'architect', 'director', 'pm'];
  const conversation = [];

  // Round 1: Each agent gives initial take
  for (const agent of agents) {
    const response = await callAI({
      systemPrompt: getRoleSystemPrompt(agent),
      userPrompt: `Evaluate this idea: ${idea}`,
      context: conversation, // See what others said
    });

    conversation.push({ agent, response });
  }

  // Round 2: Agents respond to each other
  for (const agent of agents) {
    const response = await callAI({
      systemPrompt: getRoleSystemPrompt(agent),
      userPrompt: `Respond to the other team members' points`,
      context: conversation,
    });

    conversation.push({ agent, response, round: 2 });
  }

  // Final: Consensus
  const consensus = await callAI({
    systemPrompt: 'You are a facilitator. Summarize the team discussion.',
    context: conversation,
  });

  return { conversation, consensus };
}
```

**Trade-offs**:
| Approach | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Simulated** (Current) | Simple, fast, cheap, good enough | Less "realistic" debate | MVP, most use cases |
| **Real Agents** (Future) | More realistic, deeper debate | Complex, slow, expensive | Premium feature, advanced users |

### Recommendation: Start Simulated

**Phase 1** (Now): Simulated agents in single prompt

- Easy to implement (just prompt patterns)
- Works in existing workbench
- 90% of the value

**Phase 2** (Later): Real multi-agent orchestration

- Only if users demand it
- Premium feature (Level 5)
- Requires new backend logic
