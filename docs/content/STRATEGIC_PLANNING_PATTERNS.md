# Strategic Planning Patterns for Engify.ai Workbench

**Purpose**: Interactive AI-guided tools for business decision-making  
**Target Users**: C-Level, Engineering Managers, Product Managers  
**Pattern Category**: Strategic Planning & Decision Support  
**Date**: October 29, 2025

---

## Overview

These patterns transform strategic frameworks into **interactive, AI-guided conversations** where:

1. User provides initial context
2. AI asks clarifying questions
3. User answers progressively
4. AI calculates, analyzes, and recommends
5. User gets actionable output
6. **User provides feedback** on helpfulness

**Key Principles**:

- **Teaching through doing** - Users learn frameworks while solving real problems
- **BYOD (Bring Your Own Data)** - No integrations, users input their own info
- **Security first** - Clear guidance on what NOT to share
- **Feedback loop** - System learns what's helpful

## Security & Privacy Model

### What Users Should Share

‚úÖ **Safe to input**:

- Anonymized metrics ("5,000 users" not "Acme Corp has 5,000 users")
- Generic descriptions ("GitHub integration" not proprietary feature names)
- Public information (industry standards, common frameworks)
- Personal/side project data (fully owned by user)
- Hypothetical scenarios for learning

### What Users Should NOT Share

‚ùå **Never input**:

- Company names or identifying information
- Proprietary code, algorithms, or trade secrets
- Customer data or PII
- Internal financial data (revenue, costs)
- Unreleased product details
- Confidential strategic plans

### Our Guidance to Users

**Disclaimer shown before each pattern**:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy & Security Notice

This tool helps you learn strategic frameworks. To protect your company:

‚úÖ DO: Use anonymized data, generic examples, or personal projects
‚ùå DON'T: Share company secrets, customer data, or confidential info

üí° TIP: Treat this like a public forum - only share what you'd post on Twitter.

We don't store company-specific data. All inputs are used only to generate
your analysis and improve our AI (anonymized).

```

### Realistic Usage Scenarios

**Primary Use Cases**:

1. **Personal time learning** - Engineers exploring frameworks on evenings/weekends
2. **Side projects** - Indie hackers, startups, personal SaaS projects
3. **Anonymized work scenarios** - "I have a feature with 5K users..." (no company name)
4. **Interview prep** - Learning to think strategically (allowed per our enterprise focus)
5. **Educational exercises** - Students, bootcamp grads, career switchers

**NOT for**:

- Real-time work decisions with company data (too risky)
- Replacing company tools (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- Storing company roadmaps

## Pattern 1: RICE Prioritization Assistant

### User Profile

- **Primary**: Product Managers, Engineering Managers
- **Secondary**: C-Level (strategic planning)
- **Level**: 3 (Intermediate)

### Use Case

Help teams prioritize features/initiatives using data-driven RICE framework without needing to understand the formula.

### Interactive Flow

#### Stage 1: Context Gathering

**AI**: "I'll help you prioritize this feature using the RICE framework. First, what feature or initiative are you evaluating?"

**User Input**: "GitHub integration for our prompt optimization tool"

---

#### Stage 2: Reach Questions

**AI**: "Great! Let's estimate how many users this will affect. A few questions:

1. How many total active users do you have per month?
2. What percentage of your users would likely use this GitHub integration?
3. Over what timeframe are we measuring? (default: per month)"

**User Input**:

- "10,000 monthly active users"
- "About 50% are developers who use GitHub"
- "Per month"

**AI Calculates**: Reach = 5,000 users/month

---

#### Stage 3: Impact Questions

**AI**: "Now let's assess the impact. This will affect 5,000 users per month.

Which of these best describes the expected impact?

- **Massive (3.0)**: Transforms your core value proposition, game-changer
- **High (2.0)**: Significantly improves a key metric (conversion, retention, revenue)
- **Medium (1.0)**: Noticeable improvement, users will appreciate it
- **Low (0.5)**: Minor improvement, nice-to-have
- **Minimal (0.25)**: Barely noticeable

What specific metric will this improve? (e.g., user activation, time-to-value, retention)"

**User Input**:

- "High (2.0) - This will significantly improve our activation rate"
- "Metric: Developer activation rate, currently 30%, expect to increase to 45%"

---

#### Stage 4: Confidence Questions

**AI**: "How confident are you in these estimates?

- **High (100%)**: Backed by user research, data, or proven demand (e.g., top requested feature)
- **Medium (80%)**: Some supporting evidence (competitive analysis, small user survey)
- **Low (50%)**: Educated guess, hypothesis-driven

What evidence supports this feature?"

**User Input**:

- "Medium (80%)"
- "Evidence: 47 users requested it in feedback, competitors have it, we see GitHub in 60% of user profiles"

---

#### Stage 5: Effort Questions

**AI**: "Finally, let's estimate the effort in person-months (how much work one person can do in one month).

Consider:

- Product/design work
- Engineering implementation
- Testing and QA
- Documentation

Break it down:

- Design: \_\_\_ days
- Frontend: \_\_\_ days
- Backend: \_\_\_ days
- Testing: \_\_\_ days
- Docs: \_\_\_ days"

**User Input**:

- "Design: 3 days"
- "Frontend: 10 days"
- "Backend: 15 days"
- "Testing: 5 days"
- "Docs: 2 days"

**AI Calculates**: Total = 35 days ‚âà 1.75 person-months

---

#### Stage 6: Results & Recommendations

**AI Output**:

```
üéØ RICE Score: 4,571

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This analysis is based on the data YOU provided.
Do not share this output if it contains company-specific information.

Calculation:
(Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence) / Effort
(5,000 √ó 2.0 √ó 0.80) / 1.75
= 8,000 / 1.75
= 4,571

üìä Priority Level: HIGH

This scores in the top 20% of typical features. Here's why:
‚úÖ Strong reach (5,000 users/month)
‚úÖ High impact (2.0) on activation
‚úÖ Good confidence (80%) with user data
‚úÖ Reasonable effort (1.75 person-months)

üé¨ Recommendation: PRIORITIZE THIS
- Add to Q1 2026 roadmap
- Allocate 2 person-months (buffer for unknowns)
- Track activation rate improvement

‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Factors:
- Effort estimate assumes no major API changes from GitHub
- Impact assumes 50% of developers will actually use it
- Consider MVP: Start with PR description optimization only

üìã Next Steps:
1. Create technical spec
2. Break into smaller milestones
3. Set success metrics (target: 45% activation)
4. Schedule kickoff

Would you like me to:
- Compare this to other features?
- Generate a project brief?
- Create a stakeholder presentation?

üéØ BUILD vs. BUY ANALYSIS

Your Scores:
‚îú‚îÄ Build Factors: 3/10
‚îú‚îÄ Buy Factors: 8/10
‚îî‚îÄ Hybrid Factors: 6/10

üìä RECOMMENDATION: BUY (Managed Platform)

Here's why:

‚úÖ Strong Buy Signals:
‚Ä¢ No ML/AI team (building requires specialized talent)
‚Ä¢ High time urgency (8/10) - platforms ship faster
‚Ä¢ Compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA) - platforms have this built-in
‚Ä¢ Standard workflow (not unique competitive advantage)
‚Ä¢ Medium budget (building costs more long-term)

‚ö†Ô∏è Buy Concerns (Addressable):
‚Ä¢ Proprietary SIEM integration
  ‚Üí Solution: Choose platform with flexible API connectors
‚Ä¢ Vendor lock-in concern (7/10)
  ‚Üí Solution: Choose open-standard platform, negotiate exit terms

‚ùå Build Blockers:
‚Ä¢ No ML team = 6-12 month hiring delay
‚Ä¢ Compliance certification = $100K+ and 12+ months
‚Ä¢ Ongoing maintenance = 2-3 FTE permanently

üí∞ COST COMPARISON (3-Year TCO)

BUILD:
‚îú‚îÄ Year 1: $450K (hiring, development, infrastructure)
‚îú‚îÄ Year 2: $350K (maintenance, improvements)
‚îú‚îÄ Year 3: $350K (ongoing)
‚îî‚îÄ Total: $1.15M

BUY (Managed Platform):
‚îú‚îÄ Year 1: $120K (platform + integration)
‚îú‚îÄ Year 2: $100K (platform subscription)
‚îú‚îÄ Year 3: $100K (platform subscription)
‚îî‚îÄ Total: $320K

üíµ Savings: $830K over 3 years


üé¨ RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Hybrid

- [ ] Platform setup
- [ ] SIEM connector development
- [ ] Workflow configuration
- [ ] Security testing

Month 4: Production
- [ ] Pilot with one security team
- [ ] Measure MTTR improvement
- [ ] Scale to full SOC


‚öñÔ∏è DECISION CRITERIA:

Choose BUILD if:
- Platform demos fail to meet requirements
- Compliance gaps can't be closed
- Integration proves impossible
- Cost comes in under $400K (unlikely)

Choose BUY if:
- Platform meets 80%+ of requirements
- Compliance verified
- SIEM integration feasible
- Total cost < $400K over 3 years ‚úÖ (Current estimate: $320K)


Would you like me to:
- Generate RFP for platform vendors?
- Create detailed integration architecture?
- Build financial model with sensitivity analysis?
- Draft stakeholder presentation?

## Implementation in Engify.ai Workbench

### Pattern Structure

```typescript
interface StrategyPattern {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'strategic_planning';
  level: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  targetRoles: Role[];

  stages: Stage[];

  // AI behavior
  conversationalFlow: boolean; // true = multi-turn conversation
  asksClarifyingQuestions: boolean; // true = AI asks questions
  providesCalculations: boolean; // true = AI does math
  providesRecommendations: boolean; // true = AI gives advice

  // Output format
  outputType: 'analysis' | 'decision' | 'roadmap' | 'comparison';
  visualizations: ('matrix' | 'chart' | 'table' | 'roadmap')[];
}

interface Stage {
  name: string;
  aiPrompt: string; // What AI asks
  userInputType: 'text' | 'number' | 'choice' | 'multiChoice';
  validation?: ValidationRule;
  nextStage: string | ((userInput) => string); // Dynamic flow
}
```

### User Experience Flow

```
1. User selects pattern: "RICE Prioritization Assistant"

2. AI introduces itself:
   "I'll help you prioritize using RICE. This will take 5 minutes.
    I'll ask questions, you answer, and I'll calculate the score."

3. Conversational Q&A (5-7 questions)
   - AI asks
   - User answers
   - AI acknowledges, moves to next

4. AI shows "thinking" indicator
   "Calculating your RICE score..."

5. AI presents results:
   - Score
   - Explanation
   - Recommendation
   - Next steps

6. AI offers follow-ups:
   "Would you like me to:
    - Compare to other features?
    - Generate a project brief?
    - Create stakeholder presentation?"
```
