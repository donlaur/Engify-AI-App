# Visual Agent Workflow Pattern

**Inspiration**: Modern AI coding assistants with visual workflow status  
**Purpose**: Show AI "thinking" process with simulated handoffs between roles  
**Category**: Advanced Prompt Pattern (Level 4-5)  
**Date**: October 29, 2025

---

## The Concept

Modern AI assistants show a **visual workflow** where you see the AI "handing off" work between different roles:

```
🔄 Planning your app...
✅ Plan complete

🔄 Handing off to architect...
✅ Architect reviewed - found 2 issues

🔄 Fixing architecture issues...
✅ Architecture approved

🔄 Handing off to engineer...
✅ Code generated

🔄 Handing off to QA...
⚠️ QA found 1 bug - sending back to engineer

🔄 Engineer fixing bug...
✅ All checks passed - Ready to deploy
```

**Key Features**:

1. **Visual progress** - User sees what's happening
2. **Role handoffs** - "Passing to architect..."
3. **Feedback loops** - "QA found issue, sending back..."
4. **Status updates** - Loading states, checkmarks, warnings
5. **Transparency** - User understands the process

---

## How to Implement in Engify.ai

### Approach 1: Simulated Workflow (Single Prompt)

The AI generates the **entire workflow narrative** in one response, but formats it to look like sequential handoffs.

**Prompt Pattern**:

```
You are simulating a development workflow with multiple roles reviewing work.

USER REQUEST:
[User's idea/request]

Simulate this workflow:
1. PLANNER: Break down the request into tasks
2. ARCHITECT: Review technical approach, identify issues
3. ENGINEER: Propose implementation
4. QA: Review for bugs/edge cases
5. TECH LEAD: Final approval or send back for fixes

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS A WORKFLOW:

Use these status indicators:
🔄 [Role] is working...
✅ [Role] completed: [summary]
⚠️ [Role] found issues: [what's wrong]
🔁 Sending back to [Role] to fix...

Show the handoffs between roles.
If a role finds issues, show the feedback loop.
End with final status: ✅ Approved or ⚠️ Needs work

Make it feel like a real workflow with realistic back-and-forth.
```

**Example Output**:

```
🔄 PLANNER is analyzing your request...

✅ PLANNER completed:
   Task breakdown:
   1. Add user authentication
   2. Create dashboard UI
   3. Set up database schema
   4. Add API endpoints

   Estimated effort: 2 weeks

---

🔄 Handing off to ARCHITECT...

⚠️ ARCHITECT found 2 issues:
   Issue 1: No consideration for session management
   Issue 2: Database schema doesn't account for user roles

   Recommendation: Add Redis for sessions, expand user table

---

🔁 Sending back to PLANNER to revise...

🔄 PLANNER is updating the plan...

✅ PLANNER completed (revised):
   Task breakdown:
   1. Add user authentication + session management (Redis)
   2. Create dashboard UI with role-based access
   3. Set up database schema (users, roles, sessions)
   4. Add API endpoints with auth middleware

   Estimated effort: 2.5 weeks

---

🔄 Handing off to ARCHITECT for re-review...

✅ ARCHITECT approved:
   Architecture looks solid. Redis for sessions is good.
   User roles properly modeled.
   Ready for implementation.

---

🔄 Handing off to ENGINEER...

✅ ENGINEER completed:
   Implementation approach:
   - NextAuth.js for authentication
   - Redis for session store
   - Prisma for database ORM
   - Middleware for role-based access control

   Code structure:
   /app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
   /lib/auth.ts
   /middleware.ts
   /prisma/schema.prisma

---

🔄 Handing off to QA...

⚠️ QA found 1 issue:
   Missing: Password reset flow
   Edge case: What happens if Redis is down?

   Recommendation: Add password reset, fallback to DB sessions

---

🔁 Sending back to ENGINEER to address QA feedback...

🔄 ENGINEER is fixing issues...

✅ ENGINEER completed (revised):
   Added:
   - Password reset flow with email tokens
   - Fallback to database sessions if Redis unavailable
   - Error handling for session failures

---

🔄 Handing off to QA for re-review...

✅ QA approved:
   All edge cases covered.
   Error handling looks good.
   Ready for implementation.

---

🔄 Handing off to TECH LEAD for final approval...

✅ TECH LEAD approved:
   Plan is solid, architecture is sound, implementation is clear.

   🎯 FINAL STATUS: ✅ APPROVED - Ready to build

   📋 NEXT STEPS:
   1. Set up Redis instance
   2. Configure NextAuth
   3. Create database schema
   4. Implement auth endpoints
   5. Add middleware
   6. Test password reset flow

   ⏱️ Timeline: 2.5 weeks
   💰 Cost: Redis $20/month + dev time
```

---

## Approach 2: Streaming Workflow (Advanced)

For a more realistic "live" feel, stream the workflow in real-time.

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
// Stream the workflow progressively
async function* streamAgentWorkflow(userRequest: string) {
  // Step 1: Planner
  yield { status: 'working', role: 'PLANNER', message: 'Analyzing request...' };
  const plan = await callAI({ role: 'planner', request: userRequest });
  yield { status: 'complete', role: 'PLANNER', result: plan };

  // Step 2: Architect reviews
  yield {
    status: 'working',
    role: 'ARCHITECT',
    message: 'Reviewing architecture...',
  };
  const archReview = await callAI({ role: 'architect', plan });

  if (archReview.hasIssues) {
    yield { status: 'issues', role: 'ARCHITECT', issues: archReview.issues };
    yield { status: 'working', role: 'PLANNER', message: 'Revising plan...' };
    const revisedPlan = await callAI({
      role: 'planner',
      feedback: archReview.issues,
    });
    yield { status: 'complete', role: 'PLANNER', result: revisedPlan };
  } else {
    yield { status: 'approved', role: 'ARCHITECT' };
  }

  // Continue with Engineer, QA, etc.
}

// Frontend displays as it streams
for await (const update of streamAgentWorkflow(userRequest)) {
  displayWorkflowUpdate(update);
}
```

**UI Component**:

```tsx
function WorkflowDisplay({ updates }: { updates: WorkflowUpdate[] }) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {updates.map((update, i) => (
        <div key={i} className="flex items-start gap-3">
          {/* Status Icon */}
          {update.status === 'working' && <Spinner />}
          {update.status === 'complete' && (
            <CheckCircle className="text-green-500" />
          )}
          {update.status === 'issues' && (
            <AlertTriangle className="text-yellow-500" />
          )}

          {/* Role Badge */}
          <Badge variant={getRoleColor(update.role)}>{update.role}</Badge>

          {/* Message */}
          <div className="flex-1">
            {update.status === 'working' && (
              <p className="text-gray-600">{update.message}</p>
            )}

            {update.status === 'complete' && (
              <div className="rounded bg-green-50 p-4">
                <pre className="text-sm">{update.result}</pre>
              </div>
            )}

            {update.status === 'issues' && (
              <div className="rounded bg-yellow-50 p-4">
                <p className="mb-2 font-semibold">Issues found:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                  {update.issues.map((issue, j) => (
                    <li key={j}>{issue}</li>
                  ))}
                </ul>
              </div>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Implementation in Engify.ai Workbench

### Phase 1: Simple (Simulated in Single Prompt)

**User Flow**:

1. User selects "Agent Workflow" pattern
2. User inputs their request
3. AI generates entire workflow narrative in one response
4. Formatted with status indicators and handoffs
5. User sees the "simulation" of the process

**Effort**: Low (just prompt engineering)  
**Value**: High (educational, shows how teams work)

### Phase 2: Advanced (Streaming)

**User Flow**:

1. User selects "Agent Workflow" pattern
2. User inputs their request
3. AI streams responses progressively
4. UI updates in real-time with each role's status
5. User sees "live" workflow

**Effort**: Medium (streaming UI + backend)  
**Value**: Very High (feels like real agents)

---

## Educational Value

### What Users Learn

1. **How teams collaborate** - See realistic handoffs and feedback
2. **Different role perspectives** - Understand what each role cares about
3. **Feedback loops** - See how issues get caught and fixed
4. **Process thinking** - Understand workflows, not just outcomes
5. **Prompt engineering** - Learn to orchestrate complex AI interactions

### Use Cases

**For Learning**:

- "Show me how a real code review works"
- "What does a feature planning process look like?"
- "How do teams investigate bugs?"

**For Planning**:

- "Simulate the workflow for my feature idea"
- "What issues might come up in code review?"
- "How would a team evaluate this architecture?"

**For Validation**:

- "Run my code through a simulated review"
- "Check my plan against different roles"
- "Validate my approach before implementing"
