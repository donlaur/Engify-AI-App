# QStash Setup Recommendation

## Current Situation

✅ **QStash is working** on your existing account:

- SendGrid webhook processing
- Environment variables already configured
- No issues reported

✅ **Redis is set up** on new account (`donlaur@engify.ai`):

- Free tier
- Auth cache configured
- Ready to use

## Recommendation: **Keep QStash on Existing Account**

### Why Keep It Separate?

1. **No disruption** - QStash is already working, don't break it
2. **Free tiers** - Both accounts can use free tiers ($0/month total)
3. **Separation of concerns**:
   - Existing account → QStash (message queue)
   - New account → Redis (auth cache)
4. **Risk mitigation** - If one account has issues, the other still works

### Current Setup (Recommended)

```
Existing Account:
├── QStash (SendGrid webhooks, scheduled jobs)
└── Cost: $0/month (free tier)

New Account (donlaur@engify.ai):
├── Redis (auth cache)
└── Cost: $0/month (free tier)
```

### Your Current QStash Credentials

These are already configured and working:

```bash
QSTASH_URL="https://qstash.upstash.io"
QSTASH_TOKEN="eyJVc2VySUQiOiJhZmExMGQ0MC04OTNhLTRkYTAtYWEzYy0xNGI0YTYzNjQ5MDciLCJQYXNzd29yZCI6ImRkYmE5NGFlNTBjZTQ0ZjM5NWEzNWMzMjYxYTAwZWU3In0="
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_6ewsrJxRN9kfu2kMdbtRZEqxPQ4Q"
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_77Enb4am6TKbMDKewqhWSoaEhaVK"
```

**Do NOT change these** - they're working for SendGrid webhooks.

## Alternative: Move QStash to New Account

### Only if you want to consolidate:

**Pros**:

- Everything in one account
- Easier to manage

**Cons**:

- Risk breaking SendGrid webhooks (needs testing)
- Need to update all env vars
- Need to update Vercel env vars
- Potential downtime during migration

**Steps** (if you choose this):

1. Create QStash on new account
2. Update env vars in `.env.local`
3. Update Vercel env vars
4. Test SendGrid webhooks thoroughly
5. Monitor for 24-48 hours

## Final Recommendation

**Keep QStash on existing account.**

- ✅ It's working - don't fix what isn't broken
- ✅ Both accounts are free tier
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ No risk of breaking SendGrid webhooks

**Only move QStash if:**

- You're hitting limits on the existing account
- You want to consolidate everything (and are willing to test)
- You're planning to upgrade to paid tiers anyway

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Keep QStash credentials as-is (already working)
2. ✅ Use new account for Redis only (already configured)
3. ✅ Add Redis env vars to Vercel (next step)
4. ✅ Test login speed improvement

---

**Bottom line**: Your current setup is optimal. Keep QStash where it is, use the new account for Redis.
