# Delete and Recreate Cognito User - Safe Guide

## Is It Safe to Delete and Recreate?

**Yes, it's safe IF:**

- ✅ You're just setting up/testing (no production data)
- ✅ No other systems depend on this user ID
- ✅ You can recreate it easily

**Warning - You'll Lose:**

- User ID (UUID will change)
- User history/metadata
- Any linked data (if you have sessions, logs, etc. tied to this user ID)

## Step-by-Step: Delete and Recreate

### Step 1: Delete Current User

1. **AWS Console** → Cognito → User Pools → "User pool - dz9-no"
2. **User management** → **Users**
3. **Click on your user** (`donlaur@engify.ai`)
4. **Click "Actions"** dropdown (top right)
5. **Click "Delete user"** (last option in dropdown)
6. **Confirm deletion**

### Step 2: Create New User

1. **Same page** → Click **"Create user"** button (top right)
2. **User creation form:**
   - **Username:** `donlaur@engify.ai` (or leave blank to use email)
   - **Email:** `donlaur@engify.ai`
   - **Email verified:** ✅ Check this box
   - **Password:** Enter your desired password
   - **Temporary password:** ❌ Uncheck (leave unchecked if you want permanent password)
3. **Click "Create user"**

### Step 3: Set Password (If Needed)

If you created with a temporary password:

1. **Click on the new user** (`donlaur@engify.ai`)
2. **Click "Actions"** → **"Set password"** (should be available now)
3. **Enter your password**
4. **Mark as permanent:** ✅
5. **Save**

### Step 4: Test Login

1. Go to `https://engify.ai/login`
2. Email: `donlaur@engify.ai`
3. Password: (your password)
4. Should login successfully!

## Alternative: Use "Force Change Password" Button

**Before deleting, try this:**

1. On user details page → Find **"Confirmation status"** section
2. Click the blue **"Force change password"** button
3. This might unlock the "Reset password" option
4. Then try "Actions" → **"Reset password"** again

---

## Why "Reset Password" Might Be Grayed Out

Possible reasons:

- **User status:** Must be "Enabled" (✅ yours is)
- **Email verified:** Must be verified (✅ yours is)
- **Cognito limitations:** Some user pools disable admin password resets
- **Permissions:** Your AWS user might not have full Cognito admin permissions

**Solution:** Using "Set password" directly or deleting/recreating often works better.

## Recommendation

**Try this first:**

1. Click **"Force change password"** button (in Confirmation status section)
2. Then try **"Actions"** → **"Reset password"** again

**If that doesn't work:**
Delete and recreate is perfectly safe for a new setup. Just make sure to:

- ✅ Set password during creation
- ✅ Mark email as verified
- ✅ Use permanent password (not temporary)

---

**Bottom line:** Deleting and recreating is safe if you're just setting up. No harm done!
