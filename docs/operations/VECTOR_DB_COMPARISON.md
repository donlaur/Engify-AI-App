# Vector Database: MongoDB Atlas vs Upstash Vector

## What Are Vector Databases?

Vector databases store **embeddings** (numerical representations of text) and enable **semantic search**. Instead of matching keywords, they find documents by meaning.

**Example:**

- Query: "how to improve prompts"
- Vector DB finds: "prompt optimization techniques", "writing better prompts", "prompt engineering best practices"
- Even if exact words don't match!

## Current Setup: MongoDB Atlas Vector Search

### ‚úÖ **What We Have:**

1. **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** (built into MongoDB)
   - Index configured: `vector_index` (384 dimensions)
   - Collection: `knowledge_base` (for RAG content)
   - Status: **Configured but not actively used yet**

2. **Python FastAPI Service** (`python/api/rag.py`)
   - Code exists for real vector search
   - Uses MongoDB Atlas `$vectorSearch` aggregation
   - Currently: **Not deployed** (Lambda uses mock search)

3. **Lambda RAG Handler** (`lambda/rag-lambda.py`)
   - Currently: **Basic text search** (regex matching)
   - Uses: Mock embeddings `[0.1] * 384`
   - Status: **Working but not semantic**

### üìä Current State:

```
RAG Chat Flow:
User Query ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí MongoDB Text Search ‚Üí Results

Should Be:
User Query ‚Üí Python Service ‚Üí Generate Embedding ‚Üí MongoDB Vector Search ‚Üí Results
```

## Upstash Vector: Should You Use It?

### **Recommendation: NO (for now)**

### Why Stick with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search:

1. **Already Configured** ‚úÖ
   - Vector index exists in MongoDB Atlas
   - Documentation written (`docs/rag/MONGODB_VECTOR_SEARCH_SETUP.md`)
   - Code ready (`python/api/rag.py`)

2. **No Additional Cost** ‚úÖ
   - MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is **free** (included with your MongoDB cluster)
   - Upstash Vector = **another service** (likely has costs)

3. **Data Already in MongoDB** ‚úÖ
   - Prompts, knowledge base docs are in MongoDB
   - No need to sync/duplicate data
   - Simpler architecture

4. **One Less Service** ‚úÖ
   - MongoDB handles both document storage AND vector search
   - Upstash Vector = separate database to manage

### When Upstash Vector Would Make Sense:

- ‚úÖ MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is too slow
- ‚úÖ You need advanced vector features (filtering, metadata)
- ‚úÖ You want to separate vector search from document storage
- ‚úÖ You're hitting MongoDB limits

**Current Situation:** None of these apply yet.

## Action Plan: Use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search

### Step 1: Deploy Python FastAPI Service (Not Lambda)

**Current Problem:** Lambda uses mock search

**Solution:** Deploy the Python FastAPI service (`python/api/rag.py`) which has real vector search:

```python
# This code EXISTS and works:
query_embedding = model.encode([request.query])[0]
results = collection.aggregate([
    {
        "$vectorSearch": {
            "index": "vector_index",
            "path": "embedding",
            "queryVector": query_embedding.tolist(),
            "numCandidates": 100,
            "limit": top_k
        }
    }
])
```

### Step 2: Generate Real Embeddings

**Current:** Documents don't have embeddings

**Solution:** Run embedding generation script:

```bash
# Generate embeddings for all knowledge base docs
pnpm run seed:knowledge-base  # Or create new script
```

**Options:**

- **OpenAI Embeddings**: `text-embedding-3-small` ($0.02/1M tokens)
- **Sentence Transformers**: Free but requires compute

### Step 3: Update MongoDB Documents

Add `embedding` field to all documents in `knowledge_base` collection.

### Step 4: Test Vector Search

Once embeddings are generated and documents updated, vector search will work automatically.

## Cost Comparison

| Solution                        | Cost                       | Status                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** | $0 (included)              | ‚úÖ Already configured |
| **Upstash Vector**              | Unknown (likely free tier) | ‚ùå Not configured     |
| **Pinecone**                    | $70/month                  | ‚ùå Overkill           |

## Recommendation Summary

**Stick with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search:**

1. ‚úÖ Already configured
2. ‚úÖ Free (included with MongoDB)
3. ‚úÖ Data already in MongoDB
4. ‚úÖ Code ready to use

**Don't add Upstash Vector unless:**

- MongoDB Atlas Vector Search proves insufficient
- You need features MongoDB doesn't have
- You want to separate concerns (document vs vector storage)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Python FastAPI service** (not Lambda) for real vector search
2. **Generate embeddings** for knowledge base documents
3. **Test vector search** with real queries
4. **Monitor performance** - if MongoDB is slow, THEN consider Upstash Vector

---

**Bottom Line:** You already have MongoDB Atlas Vector Search configured. Use it first before adding another service. Upstash Vector can be a backup plan if MongoDB doesn't meet your needs.
