# Python Service Deployment Options for AWS

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Question**: Do we need Docker for AWS Python deployment?

---

## üéØ **Quick Answer**

**Short Answer**: It depends on which AWS service you choose, but **Docker is NOT required** for AWS Lambda (which is what your current script uses).

**Current Setup**: Your `scripts/deploy-lambda.sh` deploys to **AWS Lambda**, which uses ZIP files, not Docker.

---

## üì¶ **AWS Deployment Options (No Docker Required)**

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: AWS Lambda (Current Setup - NO Docker)**

**What You Have**:

- Lambda deployment script: `scripts/deploy-lambda.sh`
- Lambda handler: `lambda/rag-lambda.py`

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ **No Docker needed** - uses ZIP deployment
- ‚úÖ Pay-per-use (very cost-effective)
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Already set up in your codebase

**Cons**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Package size limits**: 250MB uncompressed, 50MB zipped
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Large dependencies**: `sentence-transformers` can be 500MB+ (WON'T FIT!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cold starts**: Can be slow with ML models
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **15-minute execution limit**

**Best For**:

- Lightweight services
- Simple API endpoints
- **NOT ideal for ML/embedding services** (model too large)

**Current Status**: Your Lambda handler uses **mock embeddings** (not the real `sentence-transformers` model), so it will work!

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 2: AWS Lambda Container (Docker Optional)**

**What It Is**: Lambda with container support (up to 10GB images)

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ **Can use Docker** OR deploy from source
- ‚úÖ Larger size limits (10GB containers)
- ‚úÖ Same serverless benefits as regular Lambda
- ‚úÖ Can package ML models in container

**Cons**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still has cold start issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex than ZIP deployment

**Best For**: ML services that need large models

---

### ‚ùå **Option 3: AWS ECS Fargate (REQUIRES Docker)**

**What It Is**: Fully managed container service

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ No size limits
- ‚úÖ Always-on (good for reducing cold starts)
- ‚úÖ Full container control

**Cons**:

- ‚ùå **Requires Docker setup**
- ‚ùå More expensive (pays for running time, not requests)
- ‚ùå More complex infrastructure

**Best For**: Long-running services, complex deployments

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 4: AWS App Runner (Docker Optional)**

**What It Is**: Fully managed container service (simpler than ECS)

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ Can build from source (no Docker needed) OR use Docker
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Simple setup

**Cons**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited customization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can be more expensive

**Best For**: Web APIs, simpler deployments

---

## üöÄ **Recommended Approach for Your Project**

### **Phase 1: Keep Using Lambda (No Docker)**

Your current Lambda setup works fine because:

1. ‚úÖ Lambda handler uses **mock embeddings** (no large model)
2. ‚úÖ FastAPI service can stay on separate hosting (Railway/Render)
3. ‚úÖ No Docker needed for current Lambda deployment

**Current Deployment**:

```bash
# Deploy Lambda (no Docker)
./scripts/deploy-lambda.sh
```

**Works because**:

- Lambda handler is lightweight (just routing logic)
- Mock embeddings = no heavy dependencies
- Already tested and working

---

### **Phase 2: Deploy FastAPI Service Separately (No Docker)**

**Option A: Railway.app or Render.com** (Easiest - No Docker)

```bash
# Railway automatically detects Python and deploys
cd python
railway init
railway up

# Or Render.com
# Connect GitHub repo, point to python/ directory
# Auto-detects FastAPI and deploys
```

**Why This Works**:

- ‚úÖ No Docker file needed
- ‚úÖ They detect `requirements.txt` and `fastapi`
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployments from GitHub
- ‚úÖ $5-10/month

**Option B: AWS Lambda Container** (If you want everything on AWS)

Create `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}

CMD [ "api.rag.handler" ]
```

Then deploy:

```bash
# Build container
docker build -t engify-rag:latest .

# Deploy to Lambda
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name engify-rag-container \
  --package-type Image \
  --code ImageUri=engify-rag:latest
```

**Still requires Docker** but just for building the container.

## üí° **Recommendation**

### **For Now: NO DOCKER NEEDED**

1. **Keep Next.js on Vercel** (no changes)
2. **Deploy Lambda handler** (already works, no Docker)
3. **Deploy FastAPI service to Railway.app** (no Docker, just push code)

**Why**:

- ‚úÖ No Docker setup required
- ‚úÖ Fastest to production
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective (~$10/month)
- ‚úÖ Easy to maintain

**When You Might Need Docker Later**:

- If you want everything on AWS (ECS Fargate)
- If Lambda container limits are too restrictive
- If you need more control over the runtime environment

---

## üîß **Action Items**

### **Immediate (No Docker Required)**:

1. ‚úÖ Lambda deployment already works (`scripts/deploy-lambda.sh`)
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Deploy FastAPI to Railway/Render (they handle Python automatically)
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Update environment variables

### **If You Want Everything on AWS (Docker Required Later)**:

1. Create `Dockerfile` for FastAPI service
2. Push to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
3. Deploy to ECS Fargate or Lambda Container

But you can **absolutely avoid Docker** for now by using:

- AWS Lambda (current setup) + Railway/Render for FastAPI

## üìä **Comparison Table**

| Service                  | Docker Required? | Best For           | Cost        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **AWS Lambda (ZIP)**     | ‚ùå No            | Lightweight APIs   | Pay-per-use |
| **AWS Lambda Container** | ‚úÖ Yes (build)   | ML models          | Pay-per-use |
| **AWS ECS Fargate**      | ‚úÖ Yes           | Always-on services | Fixed price |
| **Railway/Render**       | ‚ùå No            | FastAPI services   | $5-10/month |
| **AWS App Runner**       | ‚úÖ Optional      | Simple containers  | Pay-per-use |

---

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

**You DON'T need Docker right now** if you:

1. Keep using Lambda for lightweight handlers (current setup)
2. Deploy FastAPI to Railway.app or Render.com

**You WILL need Docker later** if you:

1. Move FastAPI to AWS ECS Fargate
2. Need larger model support in Lambda
3. Want everything containerized on AWS

**My Recommendation**: Keep it simple for now, avoid Docker, and focus on getting the services deployed to production! üöÄ
