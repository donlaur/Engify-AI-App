## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Questions

### "Walk me through the architecture"

**Answer:**
"It's a full-stack Next.js 15 application with MongoDB Atlas. We use the App Router for server-side rendering and API routes for the backend. 

The frontend is React 18 with TypeScript strict mode and Tailwind CSS. We integrate with 4 AI providers through an abstraction layer - OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and Groq.

For authentication, we use NextAuth.js v5 with JWT tokens. Data is stored in MongoDB with Mongoose as the ODM. 

The app is deployed on Vercel with CI/CD through GitHub Actions. We use Sentry for error tracking and have comprehensive testing with Vitest and Playwright."

### "How did you handle multi-provider AI integration?"

**Answer:**
"I used the Strategy pattern with a common interface. Each provider implements the same `AIProvider` interface with methods like `generateText()` and `streamText()`.

This means I can swap providers without changing any calling code - it's pure Liskov Substitution Principle. The factory pattern handles provider instantiation.

All providers return the same `AIResponse` type, so the rest of the application doesn't need to know which provider is being used. This also makes testing easy - I can inject mock providers."

---

## üé® SOLID Principles

### "Explain SOLID and give examples from your code"

**S - Single Responsibility:**
"Each module has one reason to change. For example, `/lib/ai/openai-client.ts` only handles OpenAI integration. If OpenAI's API changes, that's the only file I touch."

**O - Open/Closed:**
"The AI provider system is open for extension but closed for modification. I can add a new provider by implementing the interface - no need to modify existing provider code."

**L - Liskov Substitution:**
"All AI providers are interchangeable. I can use OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini anywhere that expects an `AIProvider` - they all behave the same way."

**I - Interface Segregation:**
"I have separate interfaces for different capabilities. Not all providers support image generation, so I don't force them to implement unused methods."

**D - Dependency Inversion:**
"High-level modules depend on abstractions. API routes receive an AI provider interface, not a concrete OpenAI client. This makes testing and swapping providers trivial."

## üîÑ DRY Principle

### "How do you avoid code duplication?"

**Answer:**
"Three main strategies:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All site stats come from `/lib/constants.ts`. Change one number, it updates everywhere.

2. **Utility Functions**: Common operations like date formatting, string manipulation, validation - all in `/lib/utils/`.

3. **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components from shadcn/ui. Instead of copying card markup, I use `<Card>` component.

Example: We have 120 resources. That number appears on 5+ pages. It's defined once in constants, imported everywhere. Update it once, changes everywhere."

---

## üîí Security

### "What security measures did you implement?"

**Answer:**
"Multiple layers:

**Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 with JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds), secure cookies (httpOnly, sameSite).

**API Security**: Rate limiting (10 req/min), input validation with Zod schemas, CORS headers, CSP headers.

**Data Protection**: Environment variables for secrets, MongoDB encryption at rest, HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3).

**Prompt Injection Prevention**: Validate user input for injection patterns, sanitize outputs, rate limit per user.

**SOC 2 Roadmap**: Encryption, access controls, audit logs, monitoring, incident response plan."

### "How do you prevent prompt injection?"

**Answer:**
"I validate all user input before sending to AI providers. Check for patterns like 'ignore previous instructions', 'you are now', 'system:', etc.

Also enforce length limits (5000 chars max), sanitize special characters, and rate limit per user. If we detect suspicious patterns, we reject the request with an educational message explaining why.

Plus, we monitor for abuse patterns and can flag accounts for review."

## ü§ñ AI/LLM Concepts (Simple Explanations)

### "Explain how LLMs work" (Simple Answer)

**Answer:**
"LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text to predict the next word. They learn patterns in language - grammar, facts, reasoning.

When you give them a prompt, they generate text by predicting what should come next, word by word. They don't 'understand' like humans, but they're very good at pattern matching.

The key is the prompt - how you ask the question determines the quality of the answer. That's why prompt engineering matters."

### "What is RAG?" (Simple Answer)

**Answer:**
"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a way to give LLMs access to external knowledge.

Here's how it works:
1. Store documents in a vector database (embeddings)
2. When user asks a question, search for relevant documents
3. Include those documents in the prompt to the LLM
4. LLM generates answer based on the retrieved context

It's like giving the AI a textbook before asking it a question. Helps with accuracy and reduces hallucinations.

We're planning to implement this with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for custom knowledge bases."

### "What are embeddings?" (Simple Answer)

**Answer:**
"Embeddings are numerical representations of text. They convert words/sentences into arrays of numbers (vectors) that capture meaning.

Similar concepts have similar vectors. 'cat' and 'dog' are closer than 'cat' and 'car'.

This lets us do semantic search - find documents by meaning, not just keywords. That's the foundation of RAG."

### "What's the difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4?"

**Answer:**
"GPT-4 is larger, smarter, more expensive:
- **GPT-3.5**: Faster, cheaper ($0.002/1K tokens), good for simple tasks
- **GPT-4**: Slower, pricier ($0.03/1K tokens), better reasoning, fewer errors

I use GPT-3.5 for simple prompts and GPT-4 for complex reasoning. It's about cost vs. quality trade-offs."

---

## üé® Design Patterns

### "What design patterns did you use?"

**1. Repository Pattern:**
"Abstracts database operations. API routes don't call MongoDB directly - they use repositories. Makes testing easy and keeps data access logic centralized."

**2. Factory Pattern:**
"For creating AI providers. `AIProviderFactory.create('openai')` returns the right provider. Easy to add new providers."

**3. Strategy Pattern:**
"Different generation strategies - streaming vs batch vs cached. Choose at runtime based on requirements."

**4. Singleton Pattern:**
"Database connection is a singleton. One connection pool shared across all requests. Prevents connection exhaustion."

---

## ‚ö° Performance

### "How did you optimize performance?"

**Answer:**
"Multiple strategies:

**Server-Side Rendering**: Pages pre-rendered at build time. Users get instant content.

**Code Splitting**: Automatic via Next.js. Only load JavaScript needed for current page.

**Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component - automatic WebP, lazy loading, responsive sizes.

**Caching**: Static assets cached at CDN edge. API responses cached when appropriate.

**Database**: Indexes on frequently queried fields. Connection pooling. Query optimization.

**Bundle Size**: Tree shaking removes unused code. Total JS: ~150KB gzipped."

---

## üß™ Testing

### "What's your testing strategy?"

**Answer:**
"Four layers:

**1. Unit Tests**: Individual functions, utilities (Vitest)
**2. Integration Tests**: API routes, database operations (Vitest)
**3. E2E Tests**: User flows, critical paths (Playwright)
**4. Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparison, detect UI changes (Puppeteer + pixelmatch)

Plus TypeScript strict mode catches type errors at compile time. ESLint catches code quality issues. Prettier ensures consistent formatting.

Pre-commit hooks run tests before allowing commits. CI/CD runs full test suite on every PR."

---

## üìä Scalability

### "How would you scale this to 1M users?"

**Answer:**
"Several approaches:

**1. Horizontal Scaling**: Vercel auto-scales serverless functions. No manual intervention needed.

**2. Database**: MongoDB Atlas supports sharding. Distribute data across multiple servers.

**3. Caching**: Redis for session storage, API response caching. Reduce database load.

**4. CDN**: Static assets served from edge locations worldwide. Faster for global users.

**5. Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse, ensure fair usage. Already implemented.

**6. Microservices**: Break out heavy features (RAG, analytics) into separate services if needed.

**7. Database Optimization**: Read replicas for queries, write to primary. Indexes on all query fields."

---

## üöÄ Development Process

### "How did you build this in 24 hours?"

**Answer:**
"AI-augmented development with Windsurf + Claude Sonnet 3.5. But I made every architectural decision and reviewed every line of code.

**Key strategies:**
- Small commits (520 total) - each one functional and deployable
- Red Hat thinking - stable tech (Next.js 15.5.4, not 16.0 RC)
- TypeScript strict mode - catch errors early
- Built in public - documented everything
- Quality-first - comprehensive testing, security from day one

The AI helped with boilerplate and repetitive code. I focused on architecture, design decisions, and quality standards."

### "What would you do differently?"

**Answer:**
"Honestly, not much for a 24-hour build. But for long-term:

**1. More Tests**: Higher test coverage, especially edge cases
**2. Performance Monitoring**: More detailed metrics, APM
**3. A/B Testing**: Framework for testing features
**4. Internationalization**: Support multiple languages
**5. Mobile App**: React Native version
**6. Advanced Analytics**: User behavior tracking, funnel analysis

But for proving technical ability and shipping fast? This approach was perfect."

## üí° Problem-Solving Examples

### "Tell me about a technical challenge you faced"

**Answer:**
"Multi-provider AI integration was tricky. Each provider has different APIs, response formats, error handling.

**Challenge**: Make them interchangeable without duplicating code.

**Solution**: 
1. Defined common interface (`AIProvider`)
2. Created adapter for each provider
3. Normalized responses to common format
4. Used factory pattern for instantiation
5. Strategy pattern for different generation modes

**Result**: Can swap providers with one line change. Easy to add new providers. Testable with mocks."

### "How do you handle errors?"

**Answer:**
"Layered approach:

**1. Input Validation**: Zod schemas catch bad data before processing
**2. Try-Catch**: All async operations wrapped in try-catch
**3. Error Logging**: Sentry captures all errors with context
**4. User-Friendly Messages**: Never show stack traces to users
**5. Graceful Degradation**: If AI fails, show cached content
**6. Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff

Example: If OpenAI is down, automatically try Claude. If all providers fail, show helpful error message."
