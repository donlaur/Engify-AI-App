# Authentication Migration Plan: NextAuth → Clerk

## Problem Statement

- Login hangs for 30+ seconds (MongoDB connection timeouts)
- Forgot password emails not sending reliably
- Complex custom auth code prone to errors
- Need enterprise-level security and reliability

## Recommended Solution: Clerk

**Clerk** is the best choice for Next.js applications:

- ✅ Enterprise-ready (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA compliant)
- ✅ Handles all auth complexity (login, signup, password reset, MFA, social OAuth)
- ✅ Built-in UI components (sign-in, sign-up forms)
- ✅ Session management (no database queries needed)
- ✅ Email magic links (passwordless auth)
- ✅ Social providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication
- ✅ User management dashboard
- ✅ Fast (CDN-backed, no MongoDB dependency for auth)
- ✅ Free tier: 10,000 MAU
- ✅ Next.js 15 integration (perfect fit)

## Alternative: Auth0

- More enterprise features (SAML, enterprise SSO)
- More complex setup
- More expensive
- Overkill for most use cases

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Setup Clerk (1-2 hours)

1. Create Clerk account at https://clerk.com
2. Create new application
3. Install Clerk SDK: `pnpm add @clerk/nextjs`
4. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   ```
5. Update `src/middleware.ts` to use Clerk middleware
6. Replace login page with Clerk `<SignIn />` component
7. Replace signup page with Clerk `<SignUp />` component

### Phase 2: Migrate User Data (1-2 hours)

1. Export existing users from MongoDB
2. Import users into Clerk (via API or dashboard)
3. Set up user migration webhook to sync Clerk → MongoDB for existing data

### Phase 3: Update Application Code (2-3 hours)

1. Replace `auth()` calls with `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs`
2. Update protected routes to use Clerk middleware
3. Remove NextAuth code
4. Update user lookup to use Clerk user ID

### Phase 4: Testing & Cleanup (1 hour)

1. Test login, signup, password reset
2. Test social OAuth (Google, GitHub)
3. Remove old NextAuth dependencies
4. Update documentation

## Cost Comparison

### Current (Self-hosted)

- MongoDB connection overhead
- Email service (SendGrid)
- Maintenance time
- Risk of downtime

### Clerk

- Free: Up to 10,000 MAU
- Pro: $25/month for 10,000 MAU
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Quick Fix** (Temporary): Add timeout handling to current auth
2. **Best Solution**: Migrate to Clerk
3. **Timeline**: Can be done in 1 day

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:

1. **A)** Set up Clerk integration now (recommended)
2. **B)** Add better error handling/timeouts to current system (temporary fix)
3. **C)** Both - quick fix first, then migrate

Recommendation: **Option A** - Clerk will solve all auth issues permanently and give you enterprise-grade security.
