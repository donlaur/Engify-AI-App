# Git Workflow Standards

**Professional Git workflow and collaboration standards for Engify.ai**

## Branch Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention

All branches must follow the naming convention: `type/description`

**Types:**
- `feature/` - New features and enhancements
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes and corrections
- `hotfix/` - Critical production fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without functional changes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test improvements and additions
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks and dependencies
- `cleanup/` - Code cleanup and organization

**Examples:**
- `feature/ai-provider-integration`
- `bugfix/authentication-error`
- `hotfix/security-vulnerability`
- `refactor/api-response-handling`
- `docs/api-documentation-update`

### Branch Protection Rules

**Main Branch (`main`)**
- Requires pull request for all changes
- Requires status checks to pass
- Requires up-to-date branches
- Requires linear history
- Restricts pushes to main branch

**Development Branch (`develop`)**
- Requires pull request for all changes
- Requires status checks to pass
- Allows force pushes for maintainers

## Commit Standards

### Conventional Commits

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `ci:` - CI/CD changes
- `build:` - Build system changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): add multi-factor authentication support
fix(api): resolve rate limiting issue for AI providers
docs(architecture): update system design documentation
refactor(components): extract reusable UI components
test(api): add integration tests for user endpoints
chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

**Description:**
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Start with lowercase letter
- No period at the end
- Maximum 50 characters

**Body:**
- Explain what and why, not how
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues with `Fixes #123`

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration

- Implement Google OAuth2 provider
- Add user profile synchronization
- Update authentication middleware
- Add OAuth2 configuration validation

Fixes #456
```

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop Feature**
   ```bash
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement feature functionality"
   
   # Push to remote
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use GitHub PR template
   - Include comprehensive description
   - Request appropriate reviewers
   - Link related issues

4. **Address Feedback**
   ```bash
   # Make requested changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Merge and Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # After PR is merged
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Hotfix Process

1. **Create Hotfix Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
   ```

2. **Implement Fix**
   ```bash
   # Make minimal changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve critical security issue"
   ```

3. **Deploy and Merge**
   - Create PR for hotfix
   - Fast-track review process
   - Deploy immediately after merge
   - Cherry-pick to develop branch

### Release Process

1. **Prepare Release**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
   ```

2. **Update Version**
   - Update package.json version
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update documentation

3. **Create Release**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.0"
   git tag v1.2.0
   git push origin release/v1.2.0
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Hooks

The following checks run automatically on every commit:

1. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint validation
   - Prettier formatting
   - TypeScript type checking

2. **Security**
   - Secret detection
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Security configuration validation

3. **Testing**
   - Unit test execution
   - Integration test validation
   - Test coverage verification

### Pre-push Hooks

Additional checks before pushing to remote:

1. **Build Verification**
   - Production build test
   - Bundle size validation
   - Performance regression check

2. **Integration Tests**
   - API endpoint testing
   - Database integration validation
   - External service connectivity

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Communication

**Pull Request Comments:**
- Be constructive and specific
- Provide actionable feedback
- Use code suggestions when possible
- Acknowledge good work

**Issue Discussions:**
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Provide context and examples
- Reference related issues
- Close issues when resolved

### Code Review Standards

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact evaluated
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

**Review Response:**
- Address feedback promptly
- Ask questions for clarification
- Provide context for decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Merge Conflicts:**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/branch
git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

**Failed Checks:**
```bash
# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Fix type errors
npm run type-check

# Run tests locally
npm test
```

**Branch Cleanup:**
```bash
# Delete local branches
git branch -d feature/branch-name

# Delete remote branches
git push origin --delete feature/branch-name

# Clean up merged branches
git branch --merged | grep -v main | xargs git branch -d
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Branches Small**
   - One feature per branch
   - Regular commits
   - Frequent pushes

2. **Write Good Commit Messages**
   - Clear and descriptive
   - Follow conventional format
   - Include context

3. **Review Your Own Code**
   - Self-review before requesting review
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation

4. **Stay Up to Date**
   - Regularly sync with main
   - Resolve conflicts early
   - Keep branches current
