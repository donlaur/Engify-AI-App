## 📝 **Lessons Learned**

1. **Always audit before major deletions** - Check all folders, not just components
2. **Git is our safety net** - Everything was recoverable from history
3. **Document migrations** - Should have logged what was being removed
4. **Test after migrations** - Verify all content is accounted for
