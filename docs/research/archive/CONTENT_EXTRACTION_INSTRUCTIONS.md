# Content Extraction Instructions

## Current Status

I've created the file structure for splitting the Gemini research output into category files. However, the full content from your message needs to be extracted and processed.

## What's Needed

Please provide the full Gemini research output in one of these ways:

### Option 1: Save to File (Recommended)
Save the full Gemini research output to:
```
docs/research/guardrails/GEMINI_FULL_OUTPUT.md
```

Then I can:
1. Extract all 70 guardrails
2. Split them by category
3. Review and condense each one
4. Distribute to category files

### Option 2: Provide in Message
If the content is too large for one file, provide it in chunks by category:
- Data Integrity (10 guardrails)
- Security (22 guardrails)
- Performance (11 guardrails)
- Availability (9 guardrails)
- Financial (8 guardrails)
- Integration (10 guardrails)
- Testing (10 guardrails)

## Processing Plan

Once I have the full content, I will:

1. **Extract each guardrail** - Parse all 70 entries
2. **Split by category** - Organize into 7 category files
3. **Review length** - Ensure each guardrail is 200-250 words
4. **Condense verbose sections** - Cut unnecessary detail while keeping actionable items
5. **Verify format** - Check all sections match the condensed format
6. **Review E-E-A-T** - Ensure signals are real-world, not generic
7. **Check links** - Verify workflow and pain point references

## Review Criteria

Each guardrail should be:
- ✅ **More than brief** - Has actionable detail and context
- ✅ **Not too lengthy** - Easy to scan and follow
- ✅ **Actionable** - Clear checklist items you can implement
- ✅ **Specific** - References tools, patterns, workflows
- ✅ **SEO-optimized** - Includes real-world E-E-A-T signals

## Files Created

- `docs/research/guardrails/README.md` - Overview of structure
- `docs/research/guardrails/PROCESSING_GUIDE.md` - Detailed processing guide
- `docs/research/guardrails/data-integrity.md` - Example file with first guardrail
- Category placeholders ready for remaining guardrails

## Next Steps

1. Provide full Gemini research output
2. I'll extract and process all 70 guardrails
3. Review condensed versions
4. Commit organized files by category
