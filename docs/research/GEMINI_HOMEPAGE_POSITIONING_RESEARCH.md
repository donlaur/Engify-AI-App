## THE CHALLENGE: Education vs. Commercial Product Positioning

### Current Problem

The homepage struggles with positioning because:

1. **Dual Identity Confusion**
   - Hero section promises commercial product features ("Ship AI Guardrails With Institutional Memory")
   - But most content is free educational resources
   - Visitors see product promise but find education content
   - Creates expectation mismatch

2. **SEO Optimization Gap**
   - Current hero doesn't clearly communicate what's available NOW
   - Doesn't surface education content prominently
   - May not rank well for educational queries
   - Missing clear value proposition for free resources

3. **Conversion Friction**
   - Interviewers/hiring managers may not understand the value immediately
   - Education seekers may not realize the depth of free content
   - Commercial prospects may not see the connection to future product

### Current Homepage Hero

```
Title: "Ship AI Guardrails With Institutional Memory"
Subtitle: "Stop AI slop before it merges. Turn manual guardrails into always-on automation."
Stats: "96+ production guardrails • automation hooks for CI/CD • incident recall built in"
CTA: "Explore Guardrail Library"
```

**Issues:**
- Focuses on commercial product (not yet ready)
- Doesn't mention free educational content
- Doesn't explain what visitors can use TODAY
- May not match what inner pages offer
