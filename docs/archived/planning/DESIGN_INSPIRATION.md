## How to Adapt for Engify.ai

### Our Unique Challenges

1. **Different Use Case**: We're about learning/education, not analytics
2. **Copy-Paste Workflow**: Users browse prompts, copy, and use them
3. **Gamification**: We have levels, XP, achievements
4. **Progressive Learning**: Start simple, unlock complexity

### Design Adaptations

#### 1. **Role-Based Prompt Library**

Instead of: Generic prompt list  
**Do This**:

```
Tabs: [C-Level] [Engineering Manager] [Engineer] [PM] [Designer] [QA]
- Each tab shows prompts relevant to that role
- Different value props per role
- Role-specific examples
```

#### 2. **Results Section - Learning Outcomes**

Instead of: Generic features  
**Do This**:

```
Big Numbers Section:
- "15 Proven Patterns" (like their 80%)
- "10x Faster Prompt Creation" (like their $1.5M)
- "95% Success Rate" (like their 79%)
- "Save 2 Hours Daily" (like their 90%)

With real user testimonials
```

#### 3. **Pattern Cards (Like Their Feature Cards)**

```
[Icon] Persona Pattern
Learn to give AI a role and context
→ Try Pattern

[Icon] Chain of Thought
Break complex problems into steps
→ Try Pattern

[Icon] Few-Shot Learning
Teach by example
→ Try Pattern
```

#### 4. **Progressive Disclosure**

```
Level 1: Show 3 basic patterns
Level 2: Unlock 5 more patterns
Level 3: Unlock advanced patterns
...

Like a game progression system
```

#### 5. **Interactive Workbench Hero**

Instead of: Static hero image  
**Do This**:

```
Live Demo Section:
- Input box with example prompt
- "Optimize" button
- Shows before/after
- Explains what changed and why
- "Try it yourself" CTA
```
