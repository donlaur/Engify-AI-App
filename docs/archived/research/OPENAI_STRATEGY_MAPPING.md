# OpenAI Strategy Mapping

## How Engify.ai Patterns Align with OpenAI's Official Strategies

This document maps OpenAI's 6 official prompt engineering strategies to our comprehensive 15-pattern framework, demonstrating that we cover everything OpenAI recommends—and more.

---

## OpenAI's 6 Strategies → Our 15 Patterns

### **Strategy 1: Write Clear Instructions**

OpenAI recommends:

- Include details in your query
- Ask the model to adopt a persona
- Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts
- Specify the steps required to complete a task
- Provide examples
- Specify the desired length of the output

**Our Patterns That Cover This:**

| Our Pattern           | How It Addresses This                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Persona**           | Directly implements "adopt a persona"    |
| **Template**          | Uses delimiters and structure            |
| **Recipe**            | Specifies step-by-step instructions      |
| **Few-Shot**          | Provides examples                        |
| **KERNEL Framework**  | Ensures clarity through all 6 principles |
| **Visual Separators** | Uses delimiters for organization         |

**✅ Coverage: 6 patterns address this strategy**

---

### **Strategy 2: Provide Reference Text**

OpenAI recommends:

- Instruct the model to answer using a reference text
- Instruct the model to answer with citations from a reference text

**Our Patterns That Cover This:**

| Our Pattern                              | How It Addresses This                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** | Explicitly designed for reference text |
| **Template**                             | Can include reference sections         |

**✅ Coverage: 2 patterns address this strategy**

---

### **Strategy 3: Split Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks**

OpenAI recommends:

- Use intent classification to identify most relevant instructions
- For dialogue applications, summarize or filter previous dialogue
- Summarize long documents piecewise and construct a full summary recursively

**Our Patterns That Cover This:**

| Our Pattern               | How It Addresses This               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Chain-of-Thought**      | Breaks reasoning into steps         |
| **Recipe**                | Divides tasks into sequential steps |
| **KERNEL (Narrow Scope)** | Enforces single, focused goals      |

**New Patterns We're Adding:**

- **Intent Classification** - Route requests to appropriate handlers
- **Recursive Summarization** - Handle long documents in chunks

**✅ Coverage: 3 existing + 2 new patterns = 5 patterns**

---

### **Strategy 4: Give the Model Time to "Think"**

OpenAI recommends:

- Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
- Use inner monologue or a sequence of queries to hide the model's reasoning process
- Ask the model if it missed anything on previous passes

**Our Patterns That Cover This:**

| Our Pattern             | How It Addresses This           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Chain-of-Thought**    | Explicit step-by-step reasoning |
| **Cognitive Verifier**  | Model checks its own work       |
| **Hypothesis Testing**  | Explores multiple solutions     |
| **Reverse Engineering** | Works backwards from conclusion |
| **Critique & Improve**  | Iterative self-improvement      |

**New Pattern We're Adding:**

- **Self-Verification** - Explicit self-checking mechanism

**✅ Coverage: 5 existing + 1 new pattern = 6 patterns**

---

### **Strategy 5: Use External Tools**

OpenAI recommends:

- Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval
- Use code execution to perform more accurate calculations or call external APIs
- Give the model access to specific functions

**Our Patterns That Cover This:**

| Our Pattern  | How It Addresses This          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **RAG**      | Implements knowledge retrieval |
| **Template** | Can structure API calls        |

**Note:** This strategy is more about implementation than prompting patterns. Our workbench and testing framework provide the infrastructure for this.

**✅ Coverage: 2 patterns + infrastructure support**

---

### **Strategy 6: Test Changes Systematically**

OpenAI recommends:

- Evaluate model outputs with reference to gold-standard answers

**Our Implementation:**

| Our Feature                  | How It Addresses This                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt Testing Framework** | Batch testing against OpenAI & Gemini         |
| **Quality Metrics**          | Structure, coherence, pattern compliance      |
| **KERNEL Framework**         | Built-in quality standards (94% success rate) |

**✅ Coverage: Comprehensive testing infrastructure**
