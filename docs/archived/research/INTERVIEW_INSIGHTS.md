# Interview Insights: My Development Philosophy

**Answers to the questions that matter**

---

## 🎯 What's Most Important to Me When Building an App?

### 1. **Velocity Without Sacrificing Quality**

I don't believe in the false choice between "move fast" and "build it right." Modern tools (AI, TypeScript, CI/CD) let you do both.

**Evidence:**

- 407+ commits in one day
- Every commit is deployable
- Build passes, no errors
- Production-ready code

### 2. **User Value First, Infrastructure Second**

Start with what users see and touch. Add infrastructure when patterns emerge.

**My Approach:**

- Day 1: TypeScript files (67+ prompts ready in hours)
- Day 2: MongoDB when we need persistence
- Day 3: Tests when APIs stabilize
- Day 4: Monitoring when users arrive

**Why:** Premature optimization kills velocity. Ship, validate, then optimize.

### 3. **Transparency & Honesty**

No fake metrics. No "coming soon" placeholders. No hiding behind buzzwords.

**What I Did:**

- Removed fake user counts (was 1,200, now shows real: 0)
- Built in Public page shows the whole journey
- GitHub repo is public - see every decision
- Blog posts explain the "why" behind choices

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement**

Start simple, add complexity as needed. Don't over-engineer.

**Examples:**

- TypeScript files → Database (when validated)
- Client-side search → Server-side (when needed)
- Mock AI → Real APIs (when ready)
- Manual tests → Automated (when stable)

## 🛠️ My Development Workflow

### **Morning: Plan & Prioritize**

1. Check `CURRENT_PLAN.md` - what's the next step?
2. Review GitHub Issues/PRs
3. Set 1-3 goals for the day
4. No meetings before 10am (deep work time)

### **Development: Rapid Iteration**

1. **Small commits** - Each one is functional and deployable
2. **AI-augmented** - Cursor/Windsurf for boilerplate, human for logic
3. **Test as I go** - Manual testing in browser, automated later
4. **Ship often** - Deploy multiple times per day

### **Tools I Use:**

**AI Coding:**

- Google AI Studio (ideation, concept validation)
- Windsurf + Claude Sonnet 3.5 (primary development)
- Cursor (refactoring, code review)

**Not married to any tool** - use what works for the task.

**Development:**

- Next.js 15.5.4 (stable, not canary - stability over bleeding edge)
- TypeScript strict mode (catch bugs at compile time)
- Tailwind CSS (fast iteration, no CSS files)
- MongoDB + NextAuth (production-ready auth)

**Quality:**

- Pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- ESLint + Prettier (consistent code)
- Manual testing (automated when stable)

### **Evening: Review & Document**

1. Update `CURRENT_PLAN.md` with progress
2. Write commit messages that explain "why"
3. Document decisions in `/docs`
4. Push to GitHub (public repo, transparent)

## 💡 How I Make Technical Decisions

### **Framework: Red Hat Thinking**

When choosing tech, I ask:

1. **Is it stable?** (Production-ready > Cutting-edge)
2. **Is it secure?** (Proven > Trendy)
3. **Does the ecosystem support it?** (Tools, libraries, community)
4. **What's the business risk?** (Downtime, bugs, support)

**Example: Next.js 15.5.4 vs 16.0.0**

- 16.0.0 is newer, has cool features
- But it's RC/canary, not stable
- Chose 15.5.4: Stable, proven, Vercel-backed
- **Result:** Zero deployment issues

### **When to Optimize**

**Don't optimize:**

- Before validating with users
- When code might be thrown away
- When patterns haven't emerged

**Do optimize:**

- After user feedback
- When performance is measurably slow
- When bugs appear in production
- When patterns are clear

**Example: TypeScript Files vs Database**

- Started with TS files for 67+ prompts
- Could add 10 prompts in 5 minutes
- Database would take 2 hours (schema, migrations, APIs)
- **Decision:** Ship with TS files, migrate later if needed

## 🚀 What I'm Proud Of (This Project)

### **1. Velocity**

407+ commits in one day. Not because I'm rushing - because I'm not afraid to iterate.

### **2. Transparency**

Built in Public page shows the whole journey. GitHub repo is public. No hiding.

### **3. Quality**

Every commit is deployable. CI/CD from day one. Real auth, real AI, production-ready.

### **4. Teaching**

Blog posts explain the "why." Testing strategy doc teaches when to test. Development journey shows the process.

### **5. Pragmatism**

TypeScript files over database (speed). Next.js 15.5.4 over 16.0.0 (stability). Manual tests over automated (validation first).

## 🎓 What I Learned (This Project)

### **1. AI Tools Enable Rapid Iteration**

But only if you embrace iteration. AI suggests, human decides. AI writes boilerplate, human writes logic.

### **2. Small Commits = Big Wins**

Easy to revert. Easy to review. Shows thinking process. Never lose work.

### **3. Transparency Builds Trust**

Showing the messy middle (not just the polished end) is more valuable than hiding it.

### **4. Progressive Enhancement Works**

Start simple, add complexity as needed. Don't over-engineer.

### **5. Quality ≠ Perfection**

Production-ready doesn't mean perfect. It means functional, secure, and maintainable.

## 🤔 Questions I Ask Myself

### **Before Starting:**

- What's the user value?
- What's the simplest solution?
- Can I validate this without building it?

### **During Development:**

- Does this already exist in the codebase?
- Can I reuse an existing component?
- Is this the right level of abstraction?

### **Before Deploying:**

- Does it work?
- Is it secure?
- Can I explain this to a user?

### **After Shipping:**

- What did users actually do?
- What broke?
- What should I build next?

## 🎯 My Engineering Philosophy

### **1. Ship Fast, Learn Faster**

Old way: Plan → Design → Build → Test → Ship (weeks)  
New way: Build → Ship → Test → Iterate (hours)

### **2. No Ego, Just Results**

If something doesn't work, delete it and start over. Code is cheap, time is expensive.

### **3. Teach, Don't Just Build**

Document decisions. Explain trade-offs. Help others learn from your work.

### **4. Quality AND Velocity**

Not one or the other. Modern tools make both possible.

### **5. Transparency Over Perfection**

Show the work. Share the journey. Build in public.

## 📊 Metrics That Matter

### **What I Track:**

**Velocity:**

- Commits per day
- Features shipped per week
- Time from idea to production

**Quality:**

## 🎤 Interview Questions I Can Answer

**"How do you balance speed and quality?"**

> Modern tools (AI, TypeScript, CI/CD) make both possible. Small commits, automated checks, deploy often.

**"What's your testing philosophy?"**

> Test when APIs stabilize, not before. Don't test code you'll delete. Focus on critical paths.

**"How do you use AI in your workflow?"**

> AI for boilerplate, humans for logic. AI suggests, I decide. Guardrails through pre-commit hooks.

**"How do you make technical decisions?"**

> Red Hat thinking: Stability > Cutting-edge. Security > Trendy. Business risk first.

**"What's your biggest strength?"**

> Velocity without sacrificing quality. 407 commits in one day, all deployable, production-ready.

**"What's your biggest weakness?"**

> Impatience with slow processes. I'd rather ship and iterate than plan for weeks.
