### completeness_reviewer

**Score: 8/10**

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Required Fields**: All required fields are present (title, description, content, category, slug). However, the role field is labeled as "ROLE" instead of "slug" which might be a minor inconsistency depending on the system requirements.
   
2. **Content Completeness**: The content is mostly complete, but it lacks a specific example of a sprint context which is indicated by the placeholder "[Your sprint context here]". This is crucial for tailoring the retrospective format to the specific needs of the team.

3. **Enrichment**: The enrichment data is generally comprehensive, including case studies, examples, use cases, best practices, recommended models, and best times to use. However, there is a cut-off in the case studies section, indicating incomplete data.

4. **Empty Fields**: There is a placeholder in the content section for the sprint context, and the case studies section has a cut-off, suggesting incomplete information.

5. **Data Quality**: The data quality is generally good, but the cut-off in the case studies section affects the comprehensiveness of the information.

**Recommendations for Completion:**

1. **Complete the Sprint Context**: Provide a specific example of a sprint context to replace the placeholder "[Your sprint context here]". This will help in generating a more tailored and effective retrospective format.

### prompt_engineering_sme

**Score: 8/10**

**Technical Issues from a CS/AI Perspective:**

1. **Model Suitability:** The prompt is well-suited for models like GPT-4, which can handle nuanced and context-rich tasks. However, it may not be as effective with less advanced models that might struggle with understanding the subtleties of team dynamics and retrospective formats.

2. **Ambiguity in Context:** The placeholder `[Your sprint context here]` suggests that the user needs to input specific context, which is crucial for generating relevant and tailored outputs. Without this, the AI might generate generic responses that lack specificity.

**Recommendations for Prompt Engineering Improvements:**

1. **Clarify Context Requirements:** Provide guidance on what specific context details should be included by the user to ensure the AI can generate the most relevant and tailored retrospective format. This might include team size, specific challenges faced, or goals for the retrospective.

2. **Enhance Instruction Clarity:** While the instructions are generally clear, emphasizing the importance of context and how it affects the AI's output could improve the prompt's effectiveness. Consider adding a note on how detailed context can lead to more precise recommendations.

3. **Example Enhancement:** The examples provided are helpful, but they could be expanded to include more diverse scenarios, such as different team sizes, remote vs. in-person teams, or varying levels of team maturity.

4. **Output Structure:** Suggest a structured format for the AI's response, such as bullet points or numbered lists, to ensure clarity and ease of use for the user.

5. **Anti-patterns:** There are no significant anti-patterns present, but ensuring that the prompt explicitly avoids conflicting instructions (e.g., asking for both a creative and a standard format simultaneously) would be beneficial.

**Missing Elements That Would Improve Prompt Quality:**

1. **Detailed Context Examples:** Providing a few example contexts within the prompt itself can guide users on how to input their specific situations effectively.

2. **Feedback Loop:** Encourage users to provide feedback on the generated formats, which can help refine future prompt iterations and improve AI performance.

3. **Diversity of Formats:** While several formats are mentioned, suggesting a mechanism for the AI to generate entirely new or hybrid formats could add value, especially for teams looking for innovative approaches.

Overall, the prompt is well-structured and follows many best practices, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity around context requirements and additional examples to guide users more effectively.
