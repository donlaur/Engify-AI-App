# Content Backlog - Ideas to Integrate Later

## Email: "8 AI Skills That Actually Matter Right Now"

**Source**: Dhaval Bhatt, AI Product Accelerator  
**Date Added**: Oct 27, 2025  
**Relevance**: High - aligns with our educational mission  
**Phase to Integrate**: Phase 6 or 7 (Learning Content)

### Key Content

**The 8 Skills:**

1. **Prompt Design** - Structuring input/output for predictable results
2. **RAG Basics** - Retrieval-Augmented Generation with proprietary data
3. **API Literacy** - Wiring APIs together, reading docs, debugging
4. **No-Code Workflow Tools** - Zapier, Make, Retool for rapid prototyping
5. **UX for AI** - Design for trust, retries, editability
6. **LLM Cost Awareness** - Forecasting token spend for viability
7. **Eval Discipline** - Building test sets for accuracy/consistency
8. **Storytelling** - Packaging AI outputs into narratives

### Integration Ideas

#### 1. Learning Paths (Phase 7)

Create skill-based learning tracks:

- **Beginner Track**: Prompt Design → API Literacy → Storytelling
- **Intermediate Track**: RAG Basics → Eval Discipline → UX for AI
- **Advanced Track**: LLM Cost Awareness → No-Code Workflows

#### 2. Prompt Library Categories (Phase 5 - Later)

Add prompts for each skill:

- "Prompt Design" category with templates
- "RAG Implementation" examples
- "Cost Optimization" prompts

#### 3. Blog/Resources Section (Phase 7)

- Article: "The 8 AI Skills Every Developer Needs"
- Link to original content with attribution
- Our own take with examples

#### 4. Workbench Features (Phase 5 - Later)

- **Cost Calculator**: Show token usage and cost
- **Eval Builder**: Create test sets for prompts
- **Storytelling Mode**: Format AI outputs as narratives

#### 5. AI Coding Assistant Section (Phase 5-6)

- **No-Code Tools Guide**: How to use Zapier/Make with AI
- **API Integration Patterns**: Common API workflows
- **UX Best Practices**: Design patterns for AI products

### Action Items (For Later)

- [ ] Create "8 Skills" learning path
- [ ] Add skill-based prompt categories
- [ ] Write blog post with our perspective
- [ ] Build cost calculator in Workbench
- [ ] Add eval/testing features
- [ ] Create UX guidelines for AI products
