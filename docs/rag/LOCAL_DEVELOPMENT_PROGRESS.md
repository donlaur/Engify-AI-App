## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Documentation & Tooling Updates (Today)**

- Added `docs/testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` (unit/integration/smoke/regression/E2E and coverage)
- Added `docs/integrations/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` (env var source of truth)
- Strengthened RBAC and logging; standardized Zod validation in email route
- Fixed Twilio Verify types; centralized error logging for Twilio and usage alerts

### **Option 1: Complete Local Testing (Recommended)**

```bash
# Test all workbench tools locally
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/workbench
2. Test OKR Workbench tool
3. Test Retrospective Diagnostician tool
4. Test Tech Debt Strategist tool
5. Verify copy-paste functionality
6. Test RAG chat at http://localhost:3000/rag-chat
```

### **Option 2: AWS Deployment (Resume Focus)**

```bash
# Deploy to AWS for resume impact
1. Set up AWS Amplify project
2. Deploy Next.js application
3. Set up ECS Fargate for Python service
4. Configure MongoDB Atlas
5. Test production deployment
```

### **Option 3: Enhanced Python Service**

```bash
# Implement real RAG capabilities
1. Fix sentence-transformers dependencies
2. Implement real MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
3. Add document upload functionality
4. Test with real embeddings
```

## 🔥 **Recommendation**

**Complete local testing first, then deploy to AWS:**

1. **This Week**: Test all workbench tools locally
2. **Next Week**: Deploy to AWS Amplify + ECS Fargate
3. **Following Week**: Implement real RAG with MongoDB Atlas
4. **Month 2**: Add remaining workbench tools (coming soon)

**This approach gives you:**

- ✅ Working tools for immediate use
- ✅ AWS experience for resume
- ✅ Scalable architecture for growth
- ✅ Enterprise-grade deployment

**Ready to test locally or deploy to AWS?**
