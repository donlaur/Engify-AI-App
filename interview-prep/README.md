## 📊 Key Numbers to Memorize

### Revenue Projections
- Phase 1 (Year 1): $12.5K MRR by Month 6
- Phase 2 (Year 2): $70K MRR
- Phase 3 (Year 3): $225K MRR ($2.7M ARR)
- Year 5: $15M ARR (100 enterprise customers)

### Unit Economics
- LTV: $500K (5-year average for enterprise)
- CAC: $20K (scaled)
- LTV:CAC = 25:1 (world-class)
- Gross margin: 70-95%

### Technical Metrics
- Performance: < 2s page load, < 5s AI response
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime
- Security: SOC2-ready architecture
- Scale: 1 to 100,000 users

### Cost Estimates
- Phase 1: $0-50K to launch
- Phase 2: $100K-200K (with SOC2)
- Phase 3: $1M-2M (with FedRAMP)
- Monthly AWS: $134 (1K users) → $500 (10K users)

## 🎓 Interview Strategy

### Position Yourself

**Not**: "I built a CRUD app"  
**Yes**: "I architected an enterprise AI platform with multi-tenant architecture, SOC2 compliance roadmap, and $15M ARR potential"

**Not**: "I used MongoDB because it's easy"  
**Yes**: "I chose MongoDB Atlas for document-oriented data, native vector search for RAG, and flexible schema for rapid iteration—documented in ADR-001"

**Not**: "I'll figure out enterprise features later"  
**Yes**: "I built multi-tenant architecture from day one because enterprise is where the real revenue is—$50K contracts vs $20/month subscriptions"

### Demonstrate VP-Level Thinking

1. **Strategic Planning**: Multi-phase roadmap with clear triggers
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Multi-provider AI, BYOK model, phased compliance
3. **Business Acumen**: Unit economics, revenue model, market sizing
4. **Technical Depth**: Multi-tenant, RAG, security by design
5. **Execution**: Documentation-first, ADRs, clear milestones
