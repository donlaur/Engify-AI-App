## üí° How to Use These Numbers

### In Interviews

**When discussing scale**:
> "The architecture scales from 1 to 100,000 users. At 10K users, infrastructure costs are $500/month against $200K/month revenue‚Äîthat's 0.25% of revenue."

**When discussing unit economics**:
> "Enterprise customers have an LTV of $500K with a CAC of $20K, giving us an LTV:CAC ratio of 25:1‚Äîthat's world-class."

**When discussing strategy**:
> "We target $12.5K MRR by Month 6 in Phase 1. If we hit that, we proceed to Phase 2 with SOC2 certification. If not, we iterate on Phase 1."

**When discussing costs**:
> "By choosing MongoDB Atlas over Pinecone, we save $70-200/month. By choosing NextAuth.js over Clerk, we save $36K/year at 10K users. These strategic decisions save over $100K in Year 1."
