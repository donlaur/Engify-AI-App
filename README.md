# Engify.ai - Built in Public

**408 commits. One day. Production-ready.**

This is what modern AI-augmented engineering looks like.

## 👨‍💼 About the Developer

**Donnie Laur** - Engineering Manager who codes.

I built this platform in one day to demonstrate:

- ✅ AI-augmented development workflows
- ✅ Rapid iteration without sacrificing quality
- ✅ Modern engineering leadership
- ✅ Transparency and "built in public" philosophy

**Why this matters:** Most engineering leaders talk about AI adoption. I'm showing how it's done.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

### **1. Velocity AND Quality**

**408+ commits in one day.** Not because I'm rushing - because I'm not afraid to iterate.

- Every commit is functional and deployable
- CI/CD from day one (lint, type-check, build, security)
- Production-ready authentication (MongoDB + NextAuth)
- Real AI integration (OpenAI + Google AI)

### **2. Modern Engineering Practices**

**Quality gates visible:**

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)
- ✅ ESLint + Prettier (consistent code)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD
- ✅ Dependabot security updates
- ✅ Branch protection (main branch)

[View Quality Gates →](.github/QUALITY_GATES.md)

### **3. Strategic Decision-Making**

**Red Hat Thinking** - Stability over bleeding edge:

- Next.js 15.5.4 (stable) not 16.0.0 (RC)
- TypeScript files first, database when validated
- Manual tests before automated (validate first)
- Progressive enhancement (start simple, add complexity)

[Read Decision Log →](docs/INTERVIEW_INSIGHTS.md)

### **4. Transparency**

**Built in Public:**

- Full development journey documented
- Every decision explained
- GitHub repo is public
- No hiding behind buzzwords

## 💡 Development Philosophy

### **What I Value:**

1. **Ship Fast, Learn Faster**
   - Old way: Plan → Design → Build → Test → Ship (weeks)
   - New way: Build → Ship → Test → Iterate (hours)

2. **No Ego, Just Results**
   - If something doesn't work, delete it and start over
   - Code is cheap, time is expensive

3. **Transparency Over Perfection**
   - Show the work, share the journey
   - Built in public, learn in public

4. **Quality AND Velocity**
   - Not one or the other
   - Modern tools make both possible

## 🎓 What I Learned

### **AI-Augmented Development**

**Tools used:**

- Google AI Studio (ideation)
- Windsurf + Claude Sonnet 3.5 (development)
- Cursor (refactoring)

**Key insight:** AI suggests, human decides. AI writes boilerplate, human writes logic.

### **Progressive Enhancement**

**Start simple:**

- TypeScript files (5 min to add 10 prompts)
- Client-side search (instant)
- Mock data (validate UX)

**Add complexity when validated:**

- Database (when persistence needed)
- Server-side search (when scale requires)
- Real APIs (when users validate)

### **Small Commits = Big Wins**

**408 commits because:**

- Each commit is functional and deployable
- Easy to revert if wrong
- Shows thinking process
- Never lose work
